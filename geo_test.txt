', u'It s a 3:35 minutes sequence from the first episode, which happens immediately after Negan is done butchering his first victim from the Alexandria group.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k4gsUmw7lUThe first thing we learn is that Rick isn t the victim, as he s seen on his knees in front of Negan. ', u'The stain of fresh blood on his face tells us that the person who Negan just killed is on Rick s right side.

[u'ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Donald Trump built the Taj Mahal casino and once called it "the eighth wonder of the world."The Republican candidate in the race for the presidency   who took his Atlantic City casinos through bankruptcy four times   minced no words about Monday\'s shutdown of the gambling hall."', u'"There\'s no reason for this," Trump told The Associated Press in a recent interview as his friend and fellow billionaire Carl Icahn prepared to close the casino.J', u'Just before 6 a.m. ', u'Monday, the Taj Mahal shuttered its doors amid a strike by union members that lasted more than 100 days. ', u'It is the fifth Atlantic City casino to close since 2014.T', u'Trump said both sides should have been able to work out a deal to keep the casino open. ', u'Local 54 of the Unite-HERE union went on strike July 1, after it could not agree with Icahn on a new contract to restore health insurance and pension benefits that were terminated two years ago in bankruptcy court.I', u'Icahn decided on Aug. 3 to close the casino, saying it lacked a "path to profitability."And now, Trump said, it\'s too late."', u'"Once it closes, it\'s too expensive to ever reopen it," he said.Y', u"Yet that option is exactly what the union's president, Bob McDevitt, and many striking workers suspect might happen.M", u'McDevitt said "there\'s a strong possibility" that Icahn will keep the casino closed over the winter while conducting renovations and capital improvements, then attempt to reopen it in the spring as a non-union facility. ', u'McDevitt said union job actions including picketing and a campaign to get convention groups to patronize other Atlantic City casinos would immediately resume if the Taj attempts to reopen without a union contract.W', u'When asked about McDevitt\'s comments, Icahn spokesman Andrew Langham said: "Ask him whether the other four casinos he\'s closed ever reopened."In August, just days after Icahn announced the closure plans, work crews repaired parts of the casino\'s facade and Boardwalk entry ways. ', u'The company said that those repairs needed to be done regardless of whether the casino is open or closed.T', u'The closure of the sprawling Boardwalk casino, with its soaring domes, minarets and towers built to mimic the famed Indian historic site, cost nearly 3,000 workers their jobs, bringing the total jobs lost by Atlantic City casino closings to 11,000 since 2014.

', u'"I\'m at peace with myself." M', u'McDevitt said union members had what he termed "their Popeye moment: \'That\'s all I can stands; I can\'t stands no more,\'" he said. ', u'"For the first time in 30 years, workers stood up to Carl Icahn and made him throw in the towel." L', u'Langham had a different take.

[u'Washington (AFP) - US officials on Friday formally accused the Russian government of directing cyber attacks "intended to interfere with the US election process," amid escalating tensions between the two powers.T', u'The assertion against Russia comes with relations already frayed over stalled efforts to end violence in Syria, NATO defenses and other differences.A', u'A joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence was the first official accusation by Washington against Moscow in the spate of cyber attacks, although many analysts had said the hacks appeared to be from Russia.A', u'A US administration official said Washington would respond to the cyber attacks, without offering details."', u'"We will take action to protect our interests, including in cyberspace, and we will do so at a time and place of our choosing," said an official shortly after the statement accusing Russia of cyberattacks.T', u'The statement, however, stopped short of accusing Russia in the recent cyber attacks on state election databases."', u'"Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company," the statement said."', u'"However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian government."It was not immediately clear how Washington would respond in the matter.

', u'But the US statement said that "it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion."

[u'The Japanese Ministry of Defense has released new details about its plans for future unmanned aircraft that would fly in supporting roles, aiding piloted fighters in the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force, or JASDF. ', u'Specifically, JASDF is hoping to add two distinct craft to its fleet: unmanned wingmen that would fly in formation with and receive commands from a pilot in a conventional fighter, and a high-flying ballistic-missile defense (BMD) aircraft that would use sensor arrays to track missile threats.T', u'The BMD aircraft is slated to enter service around 2030, while the the first iteration of the unmanned wingman-which will fly ahead of fighters as a sensor carrier-is to be developed in the next 15 to 20 years. ', u'A second version of the unmanned wingman that will fire munitions and act as a missile sponge, directing incoming threats toward itself and away from the manned fighter, will be developed with the same airframe and engine as the sensor carrier if all goes according to plan. ', u"The development of these Combat Support Unmanned Aircraft is outlined in a report from the Japanese Defense Ministry's purchasing office, the Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA), which was provided to Given the difficulty of programming an autonomous system with the aerial maneuvers necessary for successful air-to-air engagements, most countries have focused on air-to-surface platforms for unmanned aircraft. ", u'Japan, however, seems to be more optimistic and hopes the unmanned craft can fly alongside its advanced stealth fighter aircraft, the F-3, which is currently under development with a planned production date in 2027. ', u"Japan's F-3s could be updated to control the unmanned wingmen, which would automatically execute maneuvers with the manned fighter and take commands from the flight leader, such as attacking designated targets or searching specific areas. ", u"The drones would then autonomously decide the best way to execute the pilot's orders.T", u'Though programming the unmanned wingmen will require very advanced AI systems, there is one big advantage to having an unmanned aircraft in a dogfighting role: It could pull maneuvers that a human pilot could never withstand with reflexes that a human pilot could never dream of. ', u'The drones could also intercept incoming missile threats and neutralize them through maneuvering, electromagnetic countermeasures, or as a last result, impacting the missile. ', u'Sacrificing the drone to protect the pilot would only be a last resort considering the unmanned wingmen would be much more expensive than a missile.T', u'The unmanned wingmen would be particularly useful for the F-3, which is currently designed to be a fighter with high endurance and heavy armaments at the expense of maneuverability. ', u'One possible configuration is a single unmanned wingman acting as a sensor hub while another in the formation carries weapons, according to Aviation Week. ', u'Another possibility is to have the manned fighter hang back as the information hub while multiple armed autonomous wingmen fly ahead to pursue targets.T', u'The ballistic-missile detector aircraft would likely be a high-altitude aircraft capable of sustained flight. ', u'There was no mention of the BMD carrying weapons, but it would instead use infrared sensors and other detecting systems to locate and track ballistic missile threats.P', u'Power and propulsion systems for the unmanned aircraft are scheduled to begin in 2019, according to Aviation Week. ', u'JASDF envisions a highly maneuverable, stealth aircraft with morphing wing configurations for the drone wingmen. ', u'The BMD design, on the other hand, appears to have a slender-wing configuration for high-flying over great distances. ', u"Japan has also expressed interested in developing drones that rely on satellite relay communication, similar to the United States' General Atomics MQ-1 Predator and the Northrop Grumman RQ-4 Global Hawk, but developing the unmanned wingmen and BMD aircraft has been given financial priority.J", u"Japan's interest in advanced air warfare systems comes with increased defense spending to counter Chinese aggressions in the South China Sea and other parts of the Pacific arena.

[u'By Scott BransfordPORTLAND, Ore. (Reuters) - Ammon Bundy, who led an armed occupation of a U.S. wildlife center in Oregon earlier this year, testified in federal court on Thursday that his hostility toward federal land ownership was shaped by his religious faith and "natural laws."Taking the witness stand for a third day at his conspiracy trial in U.S. ', u'District Court in Portland, Bundy delved further into the ideology he said was behind the forcible takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by a band of militants in January.B', u'Bundy told jurors that his group seized the refuge in rural eastern Oregon not only to protest what they saw as overreach by the U.S. government but to show how public lands should be entrusted to private citizens according to an ancient, divinely inspired set of doctrines.

[u'Samsung is currently dealing with a massive Galaxy Note 7 scandal that was caused by a faulty battery design. ', u"Unsurprisingly, even the slightest battery design error can lead to life-threatening explosions, and we've seen cars and even a house destroyed as a result. ", u'The Galaxy Note 7 isn t the only smartphone whose battery exploded, but it s the first one to be recalled because of a widespread battery defect. iPhones can explode too, although Apple never had to resort to such extreme measures to fix battery problems. ', u'And it turns out that Apple is studying ways to make its future batteries even more efficient while also ensuring that they remain safe.A', u'A new Apple patent application titled Battery Can describes technology that would let Apple create batteries that provide more energy and a longer lifespan while offering improved safety as well. ', u'Filed on April 1st and published on October 6th, the patent highlights battery enclosure technology that would ensure the safety of the user while also improving battery performance.T', u'The patent focuses on the battery enclosure rather than the battery cell, proving that Apple is very interested in creating batteries that will be less likely to explode or swell as they approach the end of their lifespan. ', u'Battery performance and lifecycles in mobile electronic and other types of computing devices are an ever increasing concern,  Apple writes. ', u'Particularly as mobile devices become smaller while the processing power and demands on such devices increase, the ability of the battery to provide the necessary power needs to the device increases in importance and competes with the desire to reduce the overall size of the device. ', u'Obtaining more power from the battery while restraining the overall size of the battery to fit within the mobile device is a continual challenge. ', u'It is with these and other issues in mind that various aspects of the present disclosure were developed. ', u'The battery can design Apple proposes will provide  increased pressure on the battery stack for higher battery performance. ', u'The battery can design could have any shape or size, giving the battery assembly  substantial form factor flexibility. ', u'Apple also details a way of manufacturing a battery can enclosure that would reduce the gap between the battery stack and the can surface compared to traditional designs. ', u'The reduced gap can result in a more intimate and/or constant contact between battery and the battery can,  Apple explains. ', u'This reduction in the gap aids in resisting swelling of the battery stack during the lifetime of the battery. ', u'Such resistance to the swelling of the battery stack may increase the performance, durability, and useful life of the battery, as well as protect the device in which the battery can is mounted. ', u'The patent specifically mentions various Apple products that could benefit from such innovations, including the iPhone, iPad, iPod and Apple TV, which are all specifically named in the patent application. ', u'The battery can technology described in the patent might also be used for laptops, computer accessories or anything else that might contain a battery.T', u'That said, there s no telling which new Apple products will actually make use of this type of battery can design, or even whether or not any Apple products already contain such batteries.']

[u"It's hard to imagine that Apple (AAPL) would know much about an industry that companies like Ford (F) have spent generations pioneering, but experts said Apple has quite a bit to work with compared to the hottest start-ups in the automotive sector.A", u'Apple has never openly confirmed it is working on a car, though CEO  has said he thinks it is possible to envision an automobile industry supply chain much like the electronics industry.T', u"The long-floating rumor recently gained more traction after a report that Apple was considering the purchase of luxury carmaker McLaren, which denies it's in talks with Apple. ", u'Lit Motors, which declined to comment to CNBC, was also reported to be in discussions with Apple, .I', u'It may seem counterintuitive for the iPhone maker to create a car, despite having resources and a powerful brand and aesthetic. ', u"But while steel and gasoline have become commoditized, a car's new essential ingredients, like cybersecurity and automation, will give technology companies like Apple an edge, said Brook Porter, partner at Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers Green Growth Fund, which invests in the future of transportation.P", u'Porter said that five years from now, he expects that the latest cars will be electric, connected, shareable and autonomous, areas where Apple has some of the best opportunities. ', u'One consumer electronics company has already made the leap: LeEco, a Chinese tech giant that makes smartphones, cloud, streaming, virtual reality headsets and now a car with Aston Martin. ', u'Once upon a time, the transition from PayPal co-founder to carmaker could have been questionable for , co-founder and CEO of Tesla (TSLA), notes Porter."', u'"But he used great engineering and design theory," Porter said of Musk. ', u'"Because if there was ever a time for someone to make a car, it\'s absolutely now."One reason that self-driving technology is suddenly heading mainstream is that one of the preferred sensors, called Lidar, is expected to get considerably cheaper over the next five years, said technology investor Michael Dempsey. ', u'Lidars, which can cost $30,000 today, may no longer be out of reach for an average consumer vehicle in the near future, Dempsey said.T', u'Technology companies, including Apple, have made crunching large data sets much easier thanks to cloud computing, graphics processing, artificial intelligence and machine learning. ', u'And being the first company to get large swaths of driving data, like 3-D maps or braking behavior, is key to bringing a successful self-driving car to market, Dempsey said."', u'"A lot of it comes down to training data," Dempsey said. ', u'"It\'s the companies that have been doing it the longest [that] will be able to understand the world better."If you\'ve carried an iPhone in your pocket for any amount of time, you know Apple knows a whole lot about you, including where you like to go and when. ', u'The company has strict policies about not storing information on user locations, but it presumably still has a lot of information it can leverage.I', u'It has recently been granted patents for a tile interface for upcoming locations on a map, location awareness between two mobile phones and a way to model crowds of people using mobile devices. ', u"Though it has faced setbacks, Apple's location technology has helped make ride-sharing services such as Uber and Lyft possible.S", u'Still, Dempsey said, there are few substitutes to having actual sensors in a car, even though more experimental technologies do exist to simulate real driving. ', u'Real driving is best to teach cars about those "one in a million" situations drivers face on the road, Dempsey said.G', u'Google, Uber and Tesla are the most well-known companies that have been testing autonomous driving technology and collecting driver data, Dempsey said, although he thinks Apple may just be keeping its testing more close to the vest. ', u'"The past 10 years have seen an unprecedented growth of investment in clean energy technology," said Yingchao Yu, founder and CEO for battery component start-up Lionano. ', u'"Many people immediately think of energy sources such as wind and solar, or final uses such as electric vehicles, but this also means that energy storage is booming."   ', u'Yu said in five years, he expects electric vehicles will be the most convenient option for car consumers. ', u'The creator of the lightning port, Apple is no stranger to battery technology, although there are differences, said Hector Abruna, director of the Energy Materials Center at Cornell. ', u'Back in the heyday of desktop computers, consumer electronics used cylindrical batteries. ', u"That's the type of battery that Tesla likely uses now, though they are a much more powerful variety, Abruna said. ", u"Today, most phones and electronic devices (likely including Apple's) use prismatic batteries, that have a flat, layered design. ", u'That type of battery is also used by many traditional car companies, according to Abruna. ', u'Levy Raiz, a partner at venture capital firm Flint Capital, points to start-ups like StoreDot, which works on batteries for both smartphones and cars, as a potential parallel for someone like Apple. ', u'Adapting the charge time and lifetime of batteries is still a major challenge, Abruna said. ', u'But Apple has made some progress in this arena, if legal documents are any indication. ', u'A lawsuit filed last year against Apple ties employees there to A123 Systems, which makes car battery solutions. ', u'Cars have already started becoming more "connected," and many have Wi-Fi connections, but unfortunately, cybersecurity is sometimes an afterthought of the years-long design process, said Jason Cook, who works at preeminent car cybersecurity division of BT Global Services. ', u'Now companies such as Microsoft are putting more advanced cloud technology behind the wheel. ', u'The company recently announced a partnership with Renault-Nissan Alliance to essentially let users "log in" to Nissan vehicles to access personalized settings. ', u'The technology will let drivers monitor their car from anywhere, use automatic payments for highway tolls, and get automatic software updates. ', u'Such technology provides incredible convenience, Jason Cook said, but also means that much more of your personal data would be available to hackers through your car. ', u'If the car is seen as a brand new "threat surface" for hackers, Cook said, users might buy cars based as much on their trust of the company\'s software as its hardware. ', u'That could be an important selling point for companies such as Apple and Microsoft, who have taken a strong stance on topics like encryption. ', u'Microsoft also announced this month a way to identify drivers of Uber cars through . ', u'It would not be surprising to see Apple use its own facial recognition technology from its cameras for security, Jason Cook said, in addition to biometric options like fingerprint scanning, and near field technology, where your phone or watch unlocked your vehicle, he said. ', u'Apple is known for its beautiful products, Cook of BT said, and it makes sense for Apple to bring that aesthetic to cars as the digital revolution hits a turning point. ', u'With products like CarPlay, Apple has already invested in owning another "screen" where users could one day be entertained and productive as their car does the bulk of the driving automatically, said Porter. ', u'"Apple has a lot to give on the consumer interface side," Raiz said. ', u'"They know how to make products stupid simple for users. That\'s exactly the direction of the industry in the next 10 to 15 years."   ', u"Apple will definitely have to invest and step up to compete with entrenched, focused players, Raiz said, but he doesn't count them out. ", u'"Why is it natural? Because currently cars are perceived as the industry due for innovation and disruption," Raiz said. ', u'"And Apple is perceived as a player that knows how to bring innovation and disruption into consumer electronics. Someday cars will just be one one more device, not a big thing like owning a house like it was 30 or 40 years ago."']

[u'Donald Trump, under fire for lewd comments he made in 2005 about groping women, offered a perfunctory apology and then promised to drag the second presidential debate scheduled for Sunday night into the gutter. ', u'Trump s mea culpa came in a brief video that he released shortly after midnight on Saturday.T', u'The Republican presidential nominee referred to the recording of him talking about grabbing a woman s genitals as a  10-year-old video  and said his comments on the tape  don t reflect who I am. ', u'I was wrong and I apologize,  Trump said.T', u'Trump s apology came several hours after the Washington Post published a clip from 2005 with audio of him discussing his efforts to  try and f***  a married woman and boasting that he subjected women to uninvited kisses and  grab[bed] them by the p****,  because  when you re a star, they let you do it. ', u'The audio was recorded when Trump filmed a segment with the show  Access Hollywood. ', u'After expressing regret for his remarks, Trump quickly turned his focus to Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. ', u'Trump concluded his statement by hinting very strongly that he will make attacking the Clintons for past sex scandals a centerpiece of his debate appearance on Sunday evening. ', u'I ve said some foolish things, but there s a big difference between the words and actions of other people. ', u'Bill Clinton has actually abused women, and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. ', u'We will discuss this more in the coming days. ', u'See you at the debate on Sunday,  Trump said in the video, which was released shortly after midnight on Saturday.T', u'Trump has toyed publicly on several occasions with bringing up sordid aspects of Bill Clinton s past. ', u'After the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, Trump praised himself for not bringing up President Clinton s infidelities almost immediately after he walked into the spin room and began talking with reporters. ', u'Trump declared that he held back because he knew the Clintons  daughter, Chelsea, was at the debate.P', u'President Clinton has admitted to conducting multiple affairs during his marriage. ', u'He has also been accused of rape and other abusive behavior.

(Photo: Facebook screenshot)Trump s performance in the first debate was widely panned, and his standing suffered in the polls. ', u'Leading up to the second debate, which will take place in St. ', u'Louis on Sunday, members of Hillary Clinton s campaign suggested they thought bringing up the dirty laundry would be a bad move for Trump. ', u'I don t think it s a smart strategy for Donald Trump to come after her with these kinds of personal attacks,  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters earlier this week.M', u'Mook was responding to Trump s prior threat to invite one of President Clinton s former paramours to the first debate.

', u'We do not necessarily expect him to come with the kind of personal and harsh attacks that he has been threatening,  Mook told reporters again Thursday. ', u'We expect a more focused, prepared Trump at this debate. ', u'But if anything could prod Trump into bringing up President Clinton s sex scandals, it might be the Clinton campaign s telling him not to, which they have done several times in the past week.B', u'Before the firestorm over Trump s comments about trying to  f*** and  grab  women, Republican consultant Liz Mair told Yahoo News the Clinton campaign was likely trying to goad Trump. ', u'The Clinton folks probably do think they re baiting him, or are hoping so, but the reality is that baiting or not, Trump is very likely to walk into this trap anyway,  said Mair, who ran a super-PAC opposing Trump. ', u'Self-immolation on live TV: It s what he does. ', u'Conventional wisdom ahead of Trump s latest controversy was that making sex-scandal-based attacks would be a disastrous tactic, especially given Hillary Clinton s role as the aggrieved spouse. ', u'Trump s resurfaced remarks would make the move even riskier. ', u'But Trump s inner circle seemed divided about how to proceed.L', u'Last month, Trump came from behind in the polls after adopting what his campaign called a  more disciplined  approach and talking about policy issues. ', u'He has since slipped. ', u'Following the vice presidential debate last Tuesday, Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway indicated a clear preference for how her candidate should behave. ', u'I do appreciate when he talks about the issues,  Conway said. ', u'Yet Trump is at his most unpredictable when he is cornered. ', u'And so the revelation of the sexually aggressive behavior he bragged about in the 2005 video may have made it more likely that Trump gets down in the mud during the debate. ', u'Trump came under intense, and unprecedented, criticism from members of his own political party Friday evening after his comments were reported. ', u'House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker both insisted that Trump back out of a scheduled appearance with them in their home state on Saturday, according to news reports. ', u'Two different sources told Yahoo News earlier Friday that Ryan and his advisers were not happy about Trump s appearance in Wisconsin and that it was not their idea. ', u'Ryan said in a statement late Friday he was  sickened  by Trump s comments in the video.

', u'Lee took great offense at that remark and, with his voice rising, he spoke directly to Trump in his own Facebook video:  With all due respect, sir   you, sir, are the distraction. ', u'Your conduct, sir, is the distraction   from the very principles that will help us win in November,  Lee said. ', u'I respectfully ask you, with all due respect, to step aside.

[u'Washington (AFP) - US officials formally accused the Russian government of trying to "interfere" with the American presidential election, and vowed to respond at an undisclosed time and place.T', u'The assertion against Russia comes with relations already frayed over NATO defenses and stalled efforts to end the bloody civil war in Syria.A', u'A joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence on Friday was the first official accusation by Washington against Moscow in the spate of cyber attacks, although many analysts had said the hacks appeared to be from Russia.A', u'A US administration official said Washington would respond to the cyber attacks, without offering details."', u'"We will take action to protect our interests, including in cyberspace, and we will do so at a time and place of our choosing," the official said."', u'"The public should not assume that they will necessarily know what actions have been taken or what actions we will take."The official statement said the US intelligence community "is confident that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations.""We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\'s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities," it added.T', u'The Kremlin labeled the allegations as "rubbish.""Every day (President Vladimir) Putin\'s website gets attacked by several tens of thousand of hackers," Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agency Interfax."', u'"A lot of these attacks are traced to the territory of the USA, but we do not blame the White House or Langley each time."The American statement said the disclosures of alleged hacked emails on WikiLeaks and other websites and by the online persona "Guccifer 2.0" were "consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts.""These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process," the statement said.T', u'The statement, however, stopped short of accusing Russia in the recent cyber attacks on state election databases."', u'"Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company," the statement said."', u'"However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian government."It was not immediately clear how Washington would respond in the matter. ', u'Officials have in the past said any cyber attacks on important US institutions would prompt a response, which could take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions, or possibly cyber measures.- \'Strong response\' -US Senator Dianne Feinstein, who last month said she and other lawmakers believed Moscow was seeking to disrupt the election, said the new statement "conveys the seriousness of the threat" to the vote. ', u'"Attempted hacking of our election system is intolerable, and it\'s critical to convince the Russian government to cease these activities," the California senator said. ', u'"If it does not, we must develop a strong response." J', u'Jason Healey, a former White House director of critical infrastructure protection who is now a researcher at Columbia University and with the Atlantic Council, said the US has tools to respond. ', u'"The initial response will be to protect and thwart what the other side wants to do," Healey told AFP. ', u'Healey said Washington is also capable of "counteroffensive cyber actions" which can limit or deter attacks. ', u'"Don\'t attack them back but use our own cyber capabilities to disrupt them," he said. ', u'"I would not call that offensive, it\'s counteroffensive." T', u'The FBI has been investigating a leak of Democratic National Committee emails, which were published by WikiLeaks in July. ', u'A hacker group using the name Guccifer 2.0 has also released leaked emails and has claimed to have hacked into the Clinton Foundation, led by former US president Bill Clinton, whose wife Hillary is the Democratic presidential nominee. ', u'But the US statement said that "it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion." T', u'That is because of the decentralized nature of the US election system, which is operated by thousands of state and local government entities. ', u'"States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process," the statement said. ', u'"Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so."']

[u'Hillary Clinton will respond to rival Donald Trump s recorded boast that he can  do anything  to women for the first time during Sunday night s debate, after her campaign made the strategic decision to lie low Saturday and let the bad news pile on Trump.C', u'Clinton expects to have an opportunity early on during the town hall debate at Washington University in St. ', u'Louis to respond to the controversy, according to a campaign aide who asked not to be identified. ', u'The moderators   ABC s Martha Raddatz and CNN s Anderson Cooper   may bring up the topic, or the undecided voters asking candidates questions may, or Trump himself may address his remarks head-on. ', u'Either way, Clinton will be ready to pounce with her prepared reaction in front of tens of millions of viewers.C', u'Clinton has not done an interview or even released a statement since the Washington Post reported on audio from 2005 in which Trump bragged about how he could  do anything  to women, including grabbing them by the genitals. ', u'Dozens of GOP officials had condemned or withdrawn their support from Trump as of Saturday night, and his own running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, said he could not  defend  Trump s comments.I', u'Instead of responding, Clinton spent hours Saturday in debate preparations with a small circle of aides in Westchester County, N.Y. ', u'Campaign leaders made the decision to have Clinton s first reaction come during the town hall, which they expect to draw one of the largest audiences they ll have between now and Election Day. ', u'Meanwhile, her official campaign Twitter account called the comments  horrific  and her staffers released a video inserting Trump s remarks with other offensive comments about women he s made in the past.I', u'It s unclear how Trump will address the controversy Sunday. ', u'In the video apology he released Friday night, the GOP nominee lashed out against President Bill Clinton, saying he has  actually abused women  and that Hillary Clinton  has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. ', u'This suggests Trump could try to deflect attention from his own comments by bringing up Bill Clinton s past infidelities and Juanita Broaddrick s rape accusation against the former president. (Trump retweeted Broaddrick on Saturday.) Clinton has brushed off Trump s comments about her husband in the past, but she s never before had to react to them in real time as she stands next to Trump.T', u'The badly wounded candidate could be even more unpredictable than usual on Sunday, according to Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan and the editor of a book about Trump s debating style. ', u'Clinton needs to be prepared for an outside-the-box Trump Hail Mary during the debate, including the announcement of a multimillion donation to Planned Parenthood or another women s group,  Kall predicted. ', u'He said Trump could throw the  kitchen sink  at Clinton and her husband, or try to deflect from the subject altogether. ', u'This makes her debate preparation extremely difficult,  Kall said. ', u'Clinton doesn t know which version of Trump will show up and how much time this explosive subject will take up. ', u'Clinton must also prepare for Trump to bring up leaked emails from her campaign chair, John Podesta, which were posted on Wikileaks Friday night and were almost entirely overshadowed by the Trump news. ', u'The emails include excerpts from Clinton s paid speeches on Wall Street and other venues, where she talked about her vision for unfettered free trade and the need for policy decisions to happen in private as well as public.T', u'The town hall style of the debate makes it risky for either candidate to spend too much time addressing the scandal or defending themselves at the expense of answering questions from undecided voters. ', u'The intimate setting also means the candidates will be physically closer to each other than at the first debate in New York, making any conflict potentially more awkward.D', u'During the first debate, Clinton baited Trump into a dayslong feud with a former Miss Universe over her weight after mentioning his treatment of Alicia Machado near the end of the 90-minute match-up. ', u'This time, the onus is already on Trump to redeem and defend himself, which means Clinton could take more of a backseat. ', u'David Axelrod, a former top adviser to Barack Obama, tweeted on Friday that the Trump video  speaks for itself,  advising the Clinton campaign to  lay off  the tweets on the matter.']

[u'Amid the firestorm over lewd comments Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made on a 2005 video that was leaked to the press on Friday, all eyes have turned to his running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence.P', u'Pence released a statement on Saturday saying he was  offended  by Trump s conduct on the clip. ', u'A campaign source told Yahoo News that Pence thought it was urgent to condemn Trump s behavior. ', u'The person also said Pence had decided not to attend a rally in Wisconsin, where he was scheduled to appear in place of Trump alongside Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. ', u'Look, he is respectful of the role he s in and would never even in a situation like this do anything to embarrass Trump or the campaign, but the fact is he canceled a public event,  the source said. ', u'He made that decision. ', u'Pence thought it was important to denounce Trump s actions and words and then give him an opportunity to speak to the American people. ', u'The source said that apart from expressing his personal distaste for Trump s behavior, Pence plans to let his running mate speak for himself. ', u'Pence probably won t make any public comments beyond his statement until after Trump s Sunday debate with Democrat Hillary Clinton. ', u'He s made the decision not to spend an ounce of time or energy focusing on anything beyond the town hall on Sunday night,  the source said of Pence.T', u'The Wisconsin rally was scheduled to be the first joint campaign appearance for Trump and Ryan. ', u'Trump had announced that Pence would be attending the event in his place after he was disinvited by Ryan following the emergence of the video.A', u'An increasing number of prominent Republicans have suggested they want to see Pence take over as the party s presidential nominee, including Sen. John Thune, R-S.D', u'D., Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H', u'H., and Rep. ', u'Scott Garrett, R-N.J', u'However, the source said Pence hasn t shared his thoughts about that. ', u'Obviously a lot of people are saying that stuff, but this isn t a conversation or topic he s weighing in on, even privately,  the source said.F', u'For his part, Trump said in Saturday afternoon newspaper interviews that he would  never withdraw  from the presidential race.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 8, 2016 The Pence campaign source suggested that allowing Trump to respond to the video on his own is a good strategy for Pence and also the  respectful  thing for a running mate to do. ', u'They also said Pence believes Trump is really the best person to address the matter in public. ', u'Spokespeople for Pence and Trump did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Yahoo News.S', u'Shortly after midnight on Saturday, Trump released a video in which he apologized for the clip, which showed him describing trying to  f***  a married woman and claiming he likes to kiss and  grab  women without necessarily being invited to do so. ', u'Trump also argued that his remarks paled in comparison to those of former President Bill Clinton, who was mired in multiple sex scandals while married to Hillary, and concluded by hinting he would air the Clinton family s dirty laundry in the second presidential debate on Sunday.P', u'Pence s apparent decision to let Trump speak for himself is notable because in the past he has served as something of a translator and ambassador for the bombastic billionaire. ', u'In his stump speeches, Pence has repeatedly assured audiences that Trump is a  good man,  and the campaign believed he could serve as a validator for Trump among conservative Christians and the Washington establishment. ', u'That strategy seemed to pay off in the vice presidential debate last Tuesday night.P', u'Pence was widely credited with presenting a more appealing version of Trump s agenda, even though many critics pointed out that he spent much of the time denying several of Trump s more controversial policies and comments.']

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   Hillary Clinton told bankers behind closed doors that she favored  open trade and open borders  and said Wall Street executives were best-positioned to help reform the U.S. financial sector, according to transcripts of her private, paid speeches leaked Friday.T', u'The leaks were the result of another email hacking intended to influence the presidential election.E', u'Excerpts of the speeches given in the years before her 2016 presidential campaign included some blunt and unguarded remarks to her private audiences, which collectively had paid her at least $26.1 million in speaking fees. ', u'Clinton had refused to release transcripts of the speeches, despite repeated calls to do so by her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders.T', u'The excerpts were included in emails exchanged among her political staff, including Campaign Chairman John Podesta, whose email account was hacked. ', u'The WikiLeaks organization posted what it said were thousands of Podesta s emails. ', u'It wasn t immediately clear who had hacked Podesta s emails, though the breach appeared to cover years of messages, some sent as recently as last month.A', u'Among the emails was a compilation of excerpts from Clinton s paid speeches in 2013 and 2014. ', u'It appeared campaign staff had read all Clinton s speeches and identified passages that could be potentially problematic for the candidate if they were to become public.O', u'One excerpt put Clinton squarely in the free-trade camp, a position she has retreated on significantly during the 2016 election. ', u'In a talk to a Brazilian bank in 2013, she said her  dream  is  a hemispheric common market, with open trade and open borders  and asked her audience to think of what doubling American trade with Latin America  would mean for everybody in this room. ', u'Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, has made opposition to trade deals a cornerstone of his campaign.P', u'Podesta posted a series of tweets Friday night, calling the disclosures a Russian hack and raising questions about whether some of the documents could have been altered. ', u'I m not happy about being hacked by the Russians in their quest to throw the election to Donald Trump,  Podesta wrote. ', u'Don t have time to figure out which docs are real and which are faked. ', u'Podesta s comments came just hours after U.S. officials publicly accused the Russian government of directing cyberattacks on political organizations and American citizens in an attempt to interfere with U.S. elections.T', u'The joint statement from the office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Homeland Security Department cited disclosures of  alleged hacked emails  on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks as being  consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. ', u'The statement didn t refer by name to the affected political institutions, but federal authorities are investigating cyberattacks on the computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.R', u'Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement,  It s not hard to see why she fought so hard to keep her transcripts of speeches to Wall Street banks paying her millions of dollars secret. ', u'The emails released Friday included exchanges between Podesta and other Clinton insiders, including campaign manager Robby Mook. ', u'Most were routine, including drafts of Clinton speeches, suggested talking points for campaign surrogates and suggested tweets to be sent out from Clinton s account.T', u'The excerpts include quotes from an October 2013 speech at an event sponsored by Goldman Sachs, in which Clinton conceded that presidential candidates need the financial backing of Wall Street to mount a competitive national campaign. ', u'Running for office in our country takes a lot of money, and candidates have to go out and raise it,  Clinton said. ', u'New York is probably the leading site for contributions for fundraising for candidates on both sides of the aisle, and it s also our economic center. ', u'And there are a lot of people here who should ask some tough questions before handing over campaign contributions to people who were really playing chicken with our whole economy. ', u'In the same speech, Clinton was also deferential to the New York finance industry, exhorting wealthy donors to use their political clout for patriotic rather than personal benefit. ', u'She also spoke of the need to include Wall Street perspectives in financial reform. ', u'The people that know the industry better than anybody are the people who work in the industry,  Clinton said.I', u'In an April 2013 speech to the National Multifamily Housing Council, Clinton said politicians must balance  both a public and a private position  while making deals. ', u'Clinton gave an example from the movie  Lincoln,  and the deal-making that went into passage of the 13th Amendment, a process she compared to sausage-making. ', u'It is unsavory, and it always has been that way, but we usually end up where we need to be,  Clinton said. ', u'But if everybody s watching, you know, all of the back room discussions and the deals, you know, then people get a little nervous to say the least. ', u'So, you need both a public and a private position. ', u'Clinton s speeches often touched on technology and privacy. ', u'In an April 2014 speech to JPMorgan, she denounced National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden for going abroad, saying,  if he really cared about raising some of these issues and stayed right here in the United States, there s a lot of whistleblower protections. ', u'But she told her audience that her time in the public eye left her sympathetic to privacy concerns. ', u'As somebody who has had my privacy scrutinized and violated for decades, I m all for privacy, believe me,  she said. ', u'Speaking on international affairs, Clinton s comments were largely in line with her positions as secretary of state, if sometimes more blunt. ', u'The Saudis have exported more extreme ideology than any other place on Earth over the course of the last 30 years,  she told the Jewish United Fund at a 2013 dinner. ', u'The speech transcripts were produced under an agreement Clinton routinely imposed on any organization that hired her to speak. ', u'The contracts, such as ones crafted by the Harry Walker Agency, required the organizations to hire, at their own expense, a stenographer who would provide the transcripts to Clinton and not keep copies for themselves. ', u'In some cases, the contracts themselves were obtained by news organizations under public records laws because Clinton was being paid to speak by public universities or colleges. ___ A', u'Associated Press writers Ted Bridis and Stephen Braun contributed to this report. ___ F', u'Follow Associated Press reporters Michael Biesecker at http://Twitter.com/mbieseck , Chad Day at http://twitter.com/ChadSDay and Jeff Horwitz at http://twitter.com/JeffHorwitz']

[u'One blue, one gray. ', u'In October 2012, 31-year-old Alex Abdo owned two suits; he chose the gray. ', u'It would be his first appearance before the Supreme Court, and just to make the stakes higher, the case was virtually impossible to crack.I', u'In 2008, Congress authorized a secret court to permit government surveillance on foreign nationals without a showing of probable cause. ', u'Abdo and the lead ACLU lawyer on the case, Jameel Jaffer, asserted the surveillance was unconstitutional. ', u'The Catch-22? ', u'Because the lawyers couldn t access records of searches and their subjects, the lawyers couldn t prove their plaintiff had been surveilled. ', u'In February 2013, the Court dismissed the case in a 5-4 decision, with the majority writing that the claims  were based too much on speculation. ', u'Discouraging for sure, but Abdo found reason to take heart later, when he learned that a certain contractor for the NSA was watching from afar   and was poised to do something about it. ', u'In June, Edward Snowden and a trio of journalists started publishing reports about the extent of state-sponsored surveillance, and for many Americans, they came as a shocker: The reports showed that the NSA had access to data from Verizon, Google, Facebook and Apple, and that millions of people in America had been caught in the dragnet. ', u'Coming soon to the list of items banned in federal buildings: https://t.co/hHsVOtqq59  Edward Snowden (@Snowden) April 27, 2016 Finally, Abdo and the ACLU had their plaintiffs. ', u'Last year, Abdo won a landmark suit against the NSA s call-records program, with a unanimous 2nd Circuit panel finding the program  an unprecedented contraction of the privacy of all Americans. ', u'Abdo s work at the ACLU deals with surveillance, online anonymity and encryption litigation. ', u'It has special relevance in our age of cyber anxiety, in which   quite apart from Hillary Clinton s email woes or Julian Assange s threats of leaks   every day seems to bring news of some new leak or breach. ', u'Just this week, news broke that the FBI has arrested another NSA contractor, possibly for stealing secret information, and that Yahoo has been scanning everyone s incoming mail at the behest of the U.S. government.A', u'Amid the cyber chaos, Abdo proceeds from a simple principle: The government must notify users when it subpoenas their information. ', u'Otherwise, he reasons, the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits the government from unreasonable search, is basically void. ', u'To that end, Abdo has led the ACLU s support of companies like Apple, which has resisted court orders to unlock an iPhone in a terrorism investigation, and Microsoft, which wants the government to notify users when it collects their data. ', u'The work is, of course, controversial, but Abdo has garnered respect on both sides. ', u'Stewart Baker, a sparring partner and former official in George W. Bush s Department of Homeland Security, says Abdo is a rarity:  Not everybody can handle an open public debate and also argue in front of some of the smartest judges in the country. ', u'Edward SnowdenPlenty of civil rights lawyers have nursed dreams of justice crusading since they were children. ', u'Not so much. ', u'He grew up in Dallas, the son of two Palestinian immigrants   Dad was a physician, Mom studied German and philosophy   and was a science and math nerd all the way. ', u'As a biology major at Yale, though, something shifted, thanks to a bioethics class. ', u'He learned about Agent Orange, an herbicide chemical. ', u'In the 1960s and 1970s, it was used in defoliation campaigns in Vietnam and Laos and caused terrible birth defects. ', u'Something about the story spoke to him, and he began thinking more seriously about how technological gains, theoretically amoral, could be used for evil ends.  [It] taught me to temper my technophilia,  he says. ', u'I still wonder at the possibilities that technology brings, but I fret, too, about its misuse. ', u'Alex Abdo (@AlexanderAbdo) October 26, 2015  He s unusual in that he is a very talented legal thinker who also has a deep understanding of technology,  Jaffer says. ', u'Freedom and security weren t opposed, Abdo says, quoting Benjamin Franklin on the point:   Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one. ', u'He landed at the ACLU for a summer internship back in 2005, and while few of the cases he worked on back then remain active, there are exceptions. ', u'One involves a 12-year-old Freedom of Information Act suit against the government to release thousands of photographs documenting prisoner abuse in Iraq and Afghanistan during the George W. Bush administration. ', u'With Ben Wizner, Snowden s lawyer, Abdo continues working on a high-profile torture case, in which a U.S. citizen was allegedly tortured by U.S. servicemen on U.S. soil. ', u'Indeed, three-odd years after the leaks began, Snowden is having a kind of moment. ', u'There s the Hollywood feature, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and a number of big-time newspaper staff editorials urging President Obama to pardon the whistleblower.

[u'Lesbos (Greece) (AFP) - A little let-down after missing out on the Nobel Peace Prize this week, the Greek islanders of Lesbos who helped rescue refugees worry that the boats will resume after a six-month lull."', u'"I worry that it will begin again, all these people waiting across (in Turkey), chased by bombs still falling in Syria," says Thanassis Marmarinos, a 63-year-old fisherman.M', u'Marmarinos is one of three residents of the coastal village of Skala Sykamias -- population 150 -- nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize this week.A', u'A year ago, alongside fellow fisherman Stratis Valiamos, he set out to sea to save migrants trying to reach Lesbos on board overcrowded, barely-floating dinghies and boats.O', u'Over 800,000 migrants and refugees crossed the Aegean last year. ', u'Hundreds died in the attempt.- \'We did our duty\' -"We did what we had to do when we saw people drowning: we saved them, that is all," he told AFP this week."', u'"I did nothing else for five months," he adds. ', u'By his count, he helped rescue 75 boats or over 4,000 people.M', u'Marmarinos, who later appeared before the European Parliament to tell of his experiences, says he was happy to do his "duty as a human being".H', u'He is still haunted by some of the images imprinted in his mind."', u'"The worst (memory) is the babies," he says.S', u"Speculation that the islanders were to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize this week -- an accolade that eventually went to the president of Colombia -- revived painful memories of the height of last year's migration crisis for Marmarinos and many fellow locals.A", u'A Nobel win would have been "justice" for Lesbos whose residents rushed to help the migrants with clothes and food as they emerged from the choppy waters of the Aegean, says 84-year-old grandmother Emilia Kamvysi.T', u"The island's brisk tourism business also took a hit this year from the migration wave.T", u'The daughter of ethnic Greek refugees from Turkey and a fisherman\'s widow, Kamvysi became an instant celebrity last year when she was photographed feeding a bottle of milk to a Syrian baby whose family had just landed in her coastal village of Skala Sykamias on Lesbos."', u'"We are a little disappointed but there were so many candidates," she said.M', u'Marmarinos says he has no regrets about missing out on the Nobel Peace Prize."', u'"We still have our good-heartedness and satisfaction about having helped these people," he said.A', u'An EU-Turkey deal that took effect in late March and NATO warship patrols have drastically reduced the number of new arrivals, which at the height of the crisis last year could number up to 6,000. ', u'The flow has dropped to a few dozen daily, but Turkey has repeatedly threatened to scuttle the agreement, accusing Europe of breaking promises over visa-free European travel. ', u'"We did our duty, and we are now well prepared to react if the flow resumes," says Sykamia community leader Giorgos Saroglou. ', u"According to Greece's migration ministry, most recent arrivals are economic migrants rather than refugees fleeing conflict. ", u'Saroglou -- a descendant of refugees himself like many on the island -- says he wants to create a museum near the beach where the migrants landed, and where some died. ', u'"We are certain that the children of these people will return to remember our warm reception," he says. ', u'"These people came to obtain help, not to convert us or harm us," says Stratis Valiamos, the other Nobel-nominated fisherman. ', u'"If bombs were falling I too would jump into a boat with my wife and daughter," he says. ', u'The tattooed 40-year-old still remembers a Syrian couple -- a doctor and his heavily pregnant wife -- who reached Lesbos with just their clothes on their back.

[u'What does your ice cream brand say about your politics?O', u'On Thursday, Ben and Jerry s came out in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. ', u'The popular ice cream maker published a strongly-worded statement that spoke out against "systemic and institutionalized racism" in American society. ', u'The company clarified that this was not a critique of the law enforcement system, and that they respect police officers  service to their communities. ', u'The company statement acknowledges that "Black Americans and white Americans have profoundly different experiences and outcomes with law enforcement and the criminal justice system," and a refusal to be silent about the problems they see. ', u'It s a stand that has been welcomed by many; their Black Lives Matter tweet has been retweeted more than 56,000 times and garnered nearly 80,000 likes.B', u'But others are frustrated with the company stance to the point of calling for a boycott.B', u'Black Lives Matter is a movement that focuses on the specific struggles that black Americans face on a daily basis. ', u'In response, the All Lives Matter movement emerged, with proponents asking, "How will this nation of ours ever join together if we are constantly looking at everyone by their race [?]" They have also expressed concerns that a very public and political focus on the struggles of black Americans may prevent necessary attention being paid to the experiences of other groups.B', u'Ben and Jerry addressed these concerns in their statement, saying, "All lives do matter. But all lives will not matter until Black lives matter." They suggest that the issues faced by black communities have been systemically under-emphasized. ', u'As some in the Black Lives Matter movement have put it: all houses matter, but the one that is burning needs the water.I', u'In August, the Movement for Black Lives released its first official platform, which called for economic justice, investments in health and safety, and community control of community institutions such as law enforcement. ', u'And some say that the ice cream maker s endorsement could inspire other businesses to address these issues.T', u"This is not the first time that Ben and Jerry's has taken a political stance. ", u'The ice cream maker is a subsidiary of Unilever (since 2000), but has its roots in Vermont, and backed their US senator, Bernie Sanders, in the Democratic primary election. ', u'The founders have also been outspoken in their support for progressive social issues: In April, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield were arrested at a protest in Washington, D.C. that aimed to make the country s democracy more inclusive.A', u'Almost every political stance is, naturally, accompanied by an ice cream flavor. ', u'For marriage equality, Ben and Jerry s cookie dough ice cream became "I Dough, I Dough." Recent get-out-the-vote efforts on college campuses have featured the flavor "Empower Mint."Other companies have found themselves drawn, perhaps unwillingly, into political debates. ', u'While he emphasized that "Starbucks is not a policy maker and as a company we are not pro- or anti-gun," in 2013, Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz asked customers to stop bringing their guns into stores, even in states where "open carry" was permissible. ', u'The company, which had not had a gun policy up to that point, had become a focal point in the gun control debate. ', u'Gun rights groups had been holding "Starbucks Appreciation Day" media events that painted the company as a proponent of open carry, while a gun safety organization pushed back with "Skip Starbucks Saturday."The move left gun rights advocates unhappy   and possibly searching for a Starbucks alternative. ', u'Starbucks has "great coffee, but I m going to be looking for an equivalent," David Butler, a family physician in Austin, Texas told the Wall Street Journal.I', u"It's unclear what effect the endorsement of Black Lives Matter will have on the company's bottom line. ", u'Certainly, the founders\' intention does not appear to have been to alienate their consumer base, but to spark a conversation about the issues the movement raises."', u'"Change happens when people are willing to listen and hear the struggles of their neighbor, putting aside preconceived notions and truly seeking to understand and grow. We\'ll be working hard on that, and ask you to as well," they wrote.R', u'Related storiesBecome a part of the Monitor community']

[u'By Mark Hosenball, Dustin Volz and Jonathan LandayWASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government for the first time on Friday formally accused Russia of a campaign of cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations ahead of the Nov. 8 presidential election."', u'"We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia\'s senior-most officials could have authorized these activities," a U.S. government statement said on Friday about hacking of political groups."', u'"These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process," the statement said.U', u'S. intelligence officials concluded weeks ago that the Russian government was conducting or orchestrating cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, possibly to disrupt or discredit the election, in which Democrat Hillary Clinton faces Republican Donald Trump.A', u'A Kremlin spokesman called the U.S. allegations "nonsense", the Interfax news agency reported.T', u"The Obama administration's decision to blame Russia for the attacks is the latest downward turn in Washington's relations with Moscow, which are under strain over Russia's actions in Syria and Ukraine and in cyberspace.A", u'Also on Friday, U.S. ', u'Secretary of State John Kerry said Russian and Syrian actions in the Syrian civil war, including bombings of hospitals, "beg for" a war crimes investigation.I', u'In addition, a U.S. intelligence official said Friday that Russia is moving short-range nuclear-capable missiles into Kaliningrad, a tiny Russian enclave between Poland and Lithuania, confirming Estonian news reports.C', u'Clinton\'s campaign chairman, John Podesta, said public blaming for the hacks left one remaining question of "why Donald Trump continues to make apologies for the Russians."

[u'VATICAN CITY (AP)   Pope Francis named 17 new cardinals Sunday, adding like-minded prelates from dioceses big and small to the club who will elect the next pope. ', u'Three were Americans in a clear signal to the conservative U.S. church hierarchy that Francis wants moderate pastors at the helm of the U.S. church.T', u'The U.S. appointments also sent a more subtle political message, weeks before the U.S. election, with the surprise pick of Indianapolis Archbishop Joseph Tobin.T', u"Tobin has openly opposed efforts by Indiana Gov. Michael Pence, now Donald Trump's running mate, to bar Syrian refugees from being resettled in the state. ", u'A U.S. federal appeals court recently used stinging language in a ruling that will prevent the Republican vice presidential candidate from barring refugee resettlement in Indiana for now.F', u'Francis has made the plight of refugees one of the hallmarks of his papacy, even bringing a dozen Syrian refugees home with him from Lesbos, Greece. ', u'He has asserted that anyone who wants to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to keep out migrants   as Trump has proposed   is "not Christian.""You can find a political message" in the Tobin appointment, said Massimo Faggioli, a Villanova University expert on the Vatican.T', u'The other new U.S. ', u'"princes" of the church include the leading U.S. moderate, Chicago Archbishop Blase Cupich, and outgoing Dallas Bishop Kevin Farrell, whom Francis tapped in August to head the Vatican\'s new family and laity office."', u'"Wow. I guess we are back!" marveled U.S. ', u'Ambassador Kenneth Hackett, a reference to the dearth of U.S. cardinal appointees in recent years.T', u"Thirteen of the new cardinals, including all the Americans, are under age 80 and thus eligible to vote in a future conclave to elect Francis' successor, the key job of a cardinal. ", u'Francis will elevate all 17 at a ceremony Nov. 19, on the eve of the closure of his Holy Year of Mercy.A', u"As is Francis' tradition, the new cardinals hail from some of the most far-flung and peripheral corners of the globe: Bangui, Central African Republic; Port Louis, Mauritius and Tlalnepantla, Mexico.S", u'Significantly, only one Italian elector was named: Francis\' ambassador to "the beloved and martyred Syria," Cardinal-elect Mario Zenari.A', u'And one of the over-80 cardinals is a clear sentimental favorite: the Rev. Ernest Troshani Simoni of Albania.S', u"Simoni, who turns 88 later this month, brought Francis to tears when he recounted his life story to the pope during Francis' 2014 visit to Tirana: the two decades he spent imprisoned, tortured and sentenced to forced labor for refusing to speak out against the Catholic Church during Albania's brutal communist rule.A", u'After embracing Simoni that day, Francis said: "Today I touched martyrs."In all, seven countries that have never had a cardinal are getting one in this, the third batch of red-hatted churchmen named by Latin America\'s first-ever pope. ', u'Despite the new nominations, though, Europe still has the most voting-age cardinals with 54."', u'"The geographical diversity is in keeping with the trajectory of recent popes to expand the global representation in the College of Cardinals to reflect the fact that the Church is universal, not simply European," said Mark Brumley, president of Ignatius Press, the leading English-language publisher of both Emeritus Pope Benedict XVI and Francis.S', u'Speaking Sunday at the end of a special Mass on the steps of St. ', u'Peter\'s Basilica, Francis said the 11 nations represented in the mix "announces and is witness to the good news of the mercy of God in every corner of the world."The new cardinals will bring the number of voting-age prelates to 120 by the end of November, the maximum allowed under current rules. ', u'Francis has appointed 44 of them, or just over a third.O', u"Of the new cardinals, Cupich is very much a pastor in Francis' likeness, emphasizing the merciful and welcoming side of the church   to the dismay of U.S. conservative Catholics. ", u"His nomination as Chicago archbishop was Francis' first major U.S. appointment and he was a Francis appointee at the pope's big family synod last year.I", u'In a statement, Cupich said his appointment was "humbling and encouraging" and said he hoped that despite the new responsibilities, he and his flock would "continue the task we have begun of renewing the church in the archdiocese and preparing it to thrive in the decades ahead." T', u"Tobin's nomination could also indicate Francis' appreciation of his support for American nuns. ", u'Tobin had been the No. 2 in the Vatican office for religious orders for only two years when in 2012, then-Pope Benedict XVI sent him back to the U.S. to head the Indianapolis archdiocese, which has fewer than 230,000 parishioners. ', u"The transfer was seen in some Vatican circles as being tied to Tobin's efforts to promote dialogue and resolve tensions between the Vatican and U.S. nuns who were subject of two separate Holy See investigations at the time. ", u'After Francis was elected, both investigations were concluded with Vatican praise for the work of the sisters. ', u'"I am shocked beyond words by the decision of the Holy Father," Tobin tweeted. ', u'"Please pray for me." B', u'Brumley, the papal publisher, said of the Americans, Tobin\'s nomination was the clear "outside the box" surprise given Indianapolis hasn\'t been a traditional archdiocese that takes a cardinal. ', u'"But he is a great bishop who combines a commitment to Catholic teaching with pastoral passion," Brumley said. ', u'Francis has made it a point to no longer automatically name cardinals from big dioceses as had been the practice for centuries. ', u'The Italian cities of Venice and Turin, for example, have been without cardinals for several years. ', u"The same goes for the U.S., where such staunchly Catholic archdioceses as Philadelphia, which hosted Francis last year at the Catholic Church's big family rally, was passed over again. ", u'Philadelphia is headed by the conservative Archbishop Charles Chaput, who has insisted on traditional church doctrine on issues such as whether civilly remarried couples can receive Communion   areas where Francis has sought greater flexibility. ', u'"It\'s a clear message to the United States Catholic bishops about the kind of church Francis has in mind," Faggioli said. ', u'Francis did make an exception to his own rule Sunday by returning a red hat to Brussels after it went without a cardinal during the tenure of Archbishop Andre Joseph Leonard, a staunch traditionalist. ', u"Francis accepted Leonard's retirement in 2015 and appointed a more progressive replacement in Archbishop Jozef De Kesel, who on Sunday was named a cardinal   one of only five Europeans named. ", u'The geographic distribution of electors still heavily favors Europe, with 54 voting-age cardinals. ', u'The Americas come next with 34 cardinals in North, South, Central America and the Caribbean. ', u'Africa has 15, Asia 14 and Oceania four.

[u'JEREMIE, Haiti (AP) -- Survivors of Hurricane Matthew put on their Sunday finest and picked their way through downed power lines to sing praise and pray in ruined churches, while desperation grew in other parts of devastated Haiti and international rescue efforts began ramping up.H', u'Haitian authorities were still unsure of the extent of the disaster, with some communities still cut off. ', u'But tens of thousands of homes were obliterated and the dead number in the hundreds.G', u'Guillaume Silvera, a senior official with the Civil Protection Agency in the storm-blasted Grand-Anse Department, which includes Jeremie, said at least 522 deaths were confirmed there alone   not including people in several remote communities still cut off by collapsed roads and bridges.N', u'National Civil Protection headquarters in Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, said Saturday its official count for the whole country was 336, which included 191 deaths in Grand-Anse.D', u"Despite the loss, families packed what remained the city's churches, many seated in pews under open sky because Matthew ripped away roofs and even walls of the sanctuaries.

', u'The 22-year-old storm refugee whose family was stuck in an emergency shelter, saw at least one bright side."', u'"There will be lots and lots of jobs since so many homes were knocked down. I\'ve been working for the last three days straight," he said in the fierce morning sun.

[u'(Correcting story first sent on Thursday with new set of pictures.)By Se Young LeeSEOUL (Reuters) - Heated meetings, sacrificed holidays and teams monitoring social media round-the-clock to track whether there have been any new smartphone fires: Samsung Electronics is still desperately trying to limit the damage of a record global recall announced more than a month ago.S', u'Samsung said most of the fire-prone Galaxy Note 7s have been recovered in major markets, including the United States and South Korea.B', u"But the trouble is not over for either South Korea's largest listed company or mobile division chief Koh Dong-jin, who bowed in a public apology last month, less than a year into the job.S", u"Samsung's hopes of finally getting ahead of the crisis took a knock on Wednesday. ", u'A replacement model began smoking inside a U.S. plane on Wednesday, the family that owns it said, prompting fresh investigations by safety regulators.A', u"And on top of that, Samsung is being pressured by one of the world's most aggressive hedge funds, Elliott Management, to split the company and pay out $27 billion in a special dividend.U", u"UNLUCKY TURNAhead of the Note 7's August launch, Koh told other executives how lucky he was: taking charge of the world's largest smartphone business just before it began to reverse two years of declining sales and market share.I", u"Instead, he was soon weathering international aviation bans on the phone, online jokes and criticism over Samsung's handling of the process. ", u"It initially wiped almost $16 billion off the company's market value.T", u'The crisis is worse than any other the company has faced, said one Samsung insider, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. ', u'"It directly impacts our products, our brand, and trust with consumers," this person said.S', u'Samsung told Reuters in a statement it was not thinking about management or organisational changes, and is focused on the Note 7 replacement process.S', u'Samsung insiders say that the unassuming Koh needs to get sales moving again so that the company can salvage the fourth quarter and defend market share against Apple Inc and other rivals."', u'"If this doesn\'t get fixed quickly, everybody loses," said a second Samsung source, who didn\'t want to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue, adding that as yet there was no finger-pointing at Koh or other executives.T', u'TV ads for the Note 7 resumed in South Korea last week, with additional incentives for those buying the device in October."', u'"We will give Note 7 all the support we were going to give it in the first place," David Lowes, Samsung\'s chief marketing officer in Europe, told Reuters. ', u'"There is no backing away from it."TOO MUCH, TOO SOON?S', u'Some of the toughest criticism levelled at Samsung has been over its fumbling of the recall.I', u'It warned affected users to immediately turn off their phones only after the same warning was issued by the U.S. consumer protection agency. ', u'The regulator criticised Samsung for not following proper recall procedures. ', u'Some consumers also complained about the replacement phones, either saying they lose power too quickly or run too hot. ', u'In China, where Samsung says its Note 7 uses safe batteries, some users claimed their phones caught fire, while it was forced to delay resuming sales in South Korea due to a slow recall progress. ', u'Eric Schiffer, brand strategy expert and chairman of Reputation Management Consultants based in Los Angeles, said Samsung needs to woo its customers. ', u'"They need to be very transparent. Invite customers who have been affected to the plants...let go of whoever was in charge of this debacle, and accept responsibility and show goodwill by sending new phones, giving discounts - anything to show the importance of the customer relationship," he said. ', u'Samsung has formed a dedicated team of public relations staff to speed up decision making and contain damage, the sources inside the company said. ', u'"We share information instantly and far more widely than usual. We try to reply more promptly," said one of them, who noted how complex it was to deal with a recall across 10 nations spread across the globe. ', u'Samsung employees say the recall has dominated internal meetings since the Sept. 2 announcement, whether it be efforts to get the recalled phones off the streets or deal with a continued stream of claims and reports of damages or problems. ', u'Long hours, weekends and cancelled tie off are commonplace.

", u'SLEEPLESS NIGHTS K', u'Koh, 55, is a Samsung veteran with previous roles in human resources and research & development.

', u'At a Galaxy S7 launch event in March, he confessed to sleepless nights agonising over how to rejuvenate a business battling falling profits and market share losses to Apple and others.W', u'With signs of a recovery - first-half mobile profits grew by nearly half - Koh had started to focus more on how to ensure steady long-term profit growth, according to a person familiar with his thinking. ', u'That all changed with reports of battery fires weeks after the Note 7 launch. ', u'Missed sales and recall expenses could cost Samsung nearly $5 billion this year, analysts say. ', u'The risk to its brand is as yet unquantifiable. ', u"Samsung's quarterly earnings forecast on Friday will provide an initial glimpse of the recall impact. ", u'It has been particularly painful because many insiders thought the Note 7 could be a landmark product. ', u'Pre-orders for the 988,900 won ($895) device were stronger than expected, and the recall cost Samsung a month-long sales window before Apple launched its new iPhone. ', u"The latest twist created by activist fund Elliott may be unwelcome to Samsung's founding Lee family, which still controls the company through a complex web of cross shareholdings.

", u'Instead it has left the company staring into the abyss.W', u'What initially seemed to be a technical glitch in a few devices swiftly turned into a full-blown crisis that looks set to inflict incalculable damage on the South Korean electronics powerhouse in a market where brand confidence and loyalty are paramount.S', u'So serious did the problem become with the Galaxy Note 7 and its exploding batteries that Samsung finally bit the bullet Tuesday and announced it was scrapping the model entirely.T', u"The move could have devastating consequences given that the large-sized Note series, along with the Galaxy S smartphones, are Samsung's flagship bearers in the fierce battle with arch-rival Apple's iPhones for supremacy in the high-end handset market.T", u"The world's largest smartphone maker announced a global recall of 2.5 million Note 7s on September 2 -- a decisive move that initially seemed to have limited the damaging fallout.B", u'But the wheels came off the whole recall process as reports emerged of replacement phones also catching fire, prompting a number of major global distributors to halt all sales and exchanges of the device.- \'Worst-case scenario\' -"This is the worst-case scenario for Samsung," said Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research."', u'"To paraphrase Oscar Wilde: To lose one version of a product to a battery issue may be considered misfortune; to lose two begins to look like carelessness," Dawson said.A', u'Analysts have suggested the recall disaster could end up costing Samsung more than $10 billion, but the larger concern will be the long-term impact on its overall brand.S', u"Samsung Electronics' mobile division may have driven its global rise, but the vast company is extremely diverse with a product line ranging from memory chips and display panels to washing machines, TVs and fridges.I", u'Its success has been built, in large part, on its ability to marry cutting-edge technology with large-scale output to produce reliable, high-quality goods across a wide price range.T', u'The initial recall of the Note 7 alone was always bound to have some brand impact, but it would have been limited if the problem was perceived as an exception.- Damaging pattern -But analysts said the issue with the replacement devices hinted at a pattern rather than a one-off -- a far more damaging problem from a brand perspective."', u'"To be in a situation where you claim to have identified the issue and solved it, only for the exact same issue to pop up again, is not a good look for a company of Samsung\'s size," Dawson said."', u'"The perceptions that flow from this may well spill over into other parts of their product portfolio," he said.T', u"The crisis has raised questions over Samsung's management and decision-making abilities at a time when the family-run conglomerate is negotiating a delicate generational change of leadership.L", u'Lee Kun-Hee, the head of Samsung Electronics as well as the parent Samsung Group, has been bedridden since suffering a heart attack in 2014. ', u'So the pressure and the spotlight are very much on the 48-year-old vice chairman and heir apparent J.Y. ', u'Lee, son of the older Lee, who was nominated to the Samsung Electronics board just days after the initial Note 7 recall was announced. - Apple pressure - G', u"Greg Roh, an analyst at HMC Investment Securities, said the management -- with all eyes on the imminent launch of Apple's iPhone 7 -- may have miscalculated in offering replacements with the recall. ", u'"I think Samsung rushed into handing out new phones when it should have taken more time for a thorough investigation," Roh said. ', u'"It was under too much pressure to dominate the market before the launch of iPhone 7," he added. ', u'The nightmare scenario for Samsung now, Roh said, would be Note 7 owners taking the refund offered by Samsung and swapping to the iconic Apple handset. ', u'"The reason consumers prefer brands like Samsung and Apple is because of product reliability. "The impact of the Note 7 will carry on to Samsung\'s next smartphone model. ', u'Overall, brand damage is inevitable and it will be costly for Samsung to turn that around again," he said.']

[u'The phablet competition is pretty tight this season with most of the big players in the smartphone industry releasing very impressive handsets. ', u'Just recently, Google joined the competition with its Pixel XL handset. ', u'After going head to head with Samsung s Galaxy Note 7, it s about time for the Android device to be pitted against another formidable Android phablet, LG s V20. ', u'LG s V10 successor debuted to good reviews with its stellar specs and features. ', u'Let s find out if the Pixel XL is worthy of being called a V20 rival.P', u'PerformanceAs flagship devices, performance is expected to be top-notch for these two. ', u'The LG V20 is equipped with a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor (two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHZ and the other two Kryo cores clocked at 1.6 GHz), 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. ', u'By today s standards, these specs are guaranteed to deliver high quality performance. ', u'However, Google may have the upper hand at this point, since its Pixel XL is powered by Qualcomm s latest quad-core Snapdragon 821 chip (two Kryo cores clocked at 2.15 GHz and two more clocked at 1.6 GHz), 4GB of RAM and an Adreno 530 GPU. ', u'Despite having very similar specifications, Qualcomm indicated on its website that the 821 chip is 10 percent better than the 820. ', u'This may not translate to a significant difference between the real time performance of the two devices, but Google s phablet is known to provide a more seamless user experience than LG s dual-screen phablet on paper. ', u'When it comes to display, both handsets are rocking large touchscreen screens with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 for protection. ', u'The V10 successor has a 5.7-inch IPS LCD display with 1440 x 2560 screen resolution and 513 ppi pixel density. ', u'On the other hand, Google s Pixel XL comes with a smaller 5.5-inch AMOLED screen with 1440 x 2560 screen resolution and 534 ppi pixel density. ', u'Although the screen sizes and pixel densities of the two are dissimilar, both handsets render colors very well. ', u'Thus, there isn t much difference in the display quality they project to the naked eye. ', u'The thing that makes the V20 stand out, however, is the inclusion of a secondary screen atop its primary display. ', u'Keeping the distinguishing feature found on its predecessor, the V20 also has a small 2.1-inch horizontal display that is dedicated solely for notifications, shortcuts and other app-specific features. ', u'This then ensures that the main screen s real estate is optimally utilized for the primary user experience. ', u'Camera TechnologyIn this day and age, smartphone users are opting to buy devices that can match their instant photography needs. ', u'For this very reason, it s clear that the V20 takes the cake when it comes to camera technology. ', u'LG s handset is boasting a dual rear camera setup comprising a standard lens with a 16-megapixel lens and a wide angle lens with an 8-megapixel lens. ', u'The two lenses make up for a photography device that is comparable to Apple s iPhone 7 Plus dual-lens camera. ', u'Enhancing the user experience of the V20 s primary camera setup are the laser and phase detection autofocus, 2x optical zoom, optical image stabilization and dual-LED flash. ', u'On the other hand, the Pixel XL s camera is  a single lens with a 12-megapixel sensor, laser and phase detection autofocus and dual-LED (dual tone) flash. ', u'If it s any consolation, the Pixel XL is armed with an 8-megapixel front-facing selfie camera, while the V20 only comes with a 5-megapixel front snapper. ', u'MiscellaneousOther determining factors that could help consumers decide include the batteries, OS versions, onboard memory variants and other features. ', u'Google s all-new phablet is powered by a non-removable Li-ion 3,450 mAh battery, while LG s device houses a removable Li-ion 3,200 mAh battery. ', u'Android OS-wise, the LG V20 is considered the device that was the first to come with Android 7.0 Nougat out of the box. ', u'Contrariwise, the Pixel XL is running the latest version of the Nougat OS, v7.1, and certain software features that are only Pixel-exclusive. ', u'Both handsets have fingerprint scanners.T', u'The Pixel XL comes in two internal memory options, 32 GB and 128 GB, without the advantage of having expandable memory via a microSD card slot. ', u'On the other hand, the V20 comes in 32 GB and 64 GB variants and it has a dedicated microSD card slot that can accommodate up to 256 GB of additional storage. ', u'The Pixel XL has Very Black, Really Blue and Quite Silver color options, whereas the V20 has Titan, Silver and Pink color variants to choose from. ', u'Finally, what sets the V20 apart from the Pixel XL and other phablets in the industry is its B  Play certified 3.5mm headphone jack and its 32-bit Hi-Fi Quad DAC technology and built-in HD Audio Recorder for unparalleled audio capabilities. ', u'Which do you think is the better phablet between Google s Pixel XL and LG s V20? ', u'Sound off in the comments below. ', u'Related Articles']

[u'Washington (AFP) - The epic patent clash between Apple and Samsung went before the US Supreme Court on Tuesday, as the smartphone giants debated the value of design in a case with major implications for the technology sector.T', u'The eight justices on the top court appeared divided on how to resolve the complex dispute over damages the South Korean smartphone giant owes Apple for copying key design features of the iPhone.T', u'The case arguments came as Samsung faces a fresh but unrelated crisis as it halted production of a flagship handset for safety reasons, potentially imperiling the powerhouse South Korean brand.S', u'Samsung, which has been ordered to pay $400 million for violating certain iPhone features, is challenging the legal precedent which requires the forfeiture of all profits from a product even if only a single design patent is infringed upon.T', u'This key question on the value of design patents has rallied Samsung supporters in the tech sector, and Apple backers in the creative and design communities.T', u'The justices Tuesday offered some support for both sides without providing a hint on the outcome of the case.J', u'Justice Anthony Kennedy said Samsung\'s argument would create confusion for jurors in trying to apportion damages."', u'"If I\'m the juror, I just don\'t know what to do," Kennedy told attorneys during the hearing. ', u'"I\'d have the iPhone in the jury room; I\'d -- I\'d look at it. I just wouldn\'t know."- VW Beetle example -The court debate moved from smartphones to automobiles, and the importance of design to the Volkswagen Beetle, for example.J', u'Justice Samuel Alito appeared to lean toward Samsung\'s position, saying, "Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks... What if it broke down every 50 miles?"Offering a similar view, Justice Stephen Breyer said a single component cannot account for all profits: "A Rolls Royce thing on the hood? No, no, no. You don\'t get all the profit from the car."Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said the justices should consider all the components of a smartphone."', u'"A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work," she said.S', u'She said the case could lead to more litigations because patent holders "carve the product up into multiple partial design claims... and find a little sliver of the phone on which infringement can be found."- Design \'not a component\' -Apple lawyer Seth Waxman fired back that Samsung made a conscious decision to revive its fortunes by copying the iPhone."', u'"A design is not a component, a design is applied to a thing," Waxman said.W', u'Waxman contended that Samsung\'s own documents showed that the South Korean giant acted to deal with "a crisis of design" and sought to copy the iPhone. ', u'He noted that limiting the damages would offer little deterrence and encourage "counterfeiters and copyists." O', u'Observers are watching to see how the court -- which has not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- tips the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. ', u'A ruling is expected in several months. ', u"The case is one element of the $548 million penalty Samsung was ordered to pay for copying the iPhone's distinctive front screen and graphical touchscreen interface. ", u'Matt Levy of the Computer & Communications Industry Association said the debate suggested the justices were open to lowering the jury award. ', u'"The damages statute for design patents was written to protect products like rugs, where the design was essentially the entire thing being sold," Levy said in a blog post. ', u'"Congress certainly didn\'t intend to treat complex products as if only the outer appearance is what matters.... Based on what I heard, I think it\'s very likely that the (justices) will modify the lower court\'s decision." S', u'Samsung has won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard. ', u'Apple is supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. ', u'An amicus brief filed on behalf of design professionals, researchers and academics said they have no financial interest in the case but argue on the basis of "fundamental principles of visual design." T', u'They cite precedents like the Coca-Cola bottle, which is an integral part of the value of the product. ', u'The Supreme Court hearing took place hours after Samsung announced it was scrapping the production of Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, its new flagship device that has been mired in a disastrous recall over exploding lithium-ion batteries.']

', u"While well-made batteries stop charging automatically once full, a faulty battery's lithium ions can collect in one spot and be deposited as metallic lithium within the battery if left plugged in for too long, Gordon said.

[u'In one state, their models will tell them they can win as long as they turn out voters who usually vote for their party. ', u'They will put the most effort into making sure reliable supporters who are unreliable voters show up at the polls. ', u'And their messaging   on TV, through targeted digital advertising, through radio and through the scripts that volunteers follow when making calls and knocking on doors   will be aimed at motivating people already in their camp, which is often a different kind of message than one intended to persuade a more moderate, middle-of-the-road voter.I', u'In another state, a campaign s models will tell it that the undecided voters who are open to persuasion hold the key to victory. ', u'That will require a very different kind of messaging campaign to those voters. ', u'Different ads will play on the TV stations in that state. ', u'Different types of mail pieces will be sent, emphasizing different issues. ', u'And the scripts for voter contact will follow suit.A', u'And in a third state, a campaign will know that unless it finds a certain number of unregistered voters who are likely to support it, get them registered and turn them out to vote, it will lose that state.T', u'These state-by-state models will also dictate what positions a candidate takes on issues specific to each state   such as ethanol subsidies in Iowa or the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste site in Nevada   and where the candidate and his or her surrogates travel in the state. ', u'Trump was asked about Yucca recently and did not have an answer. ', u'That does not necessarily mean his campaign had not studied the impact of that issue on its voter universe, though it s possible. ', u'Trump s well-established lack of interest in policy details could also have been to blame.E', u'Every action that campaigns take flows from those universes and voter scores. ', u'But they will also continue to update their universes and their models week by week and even day by day, often doing nightly rounds of calls to voters in states that are the closest contests. ', u'The information they get from the hundreds or thousands of responses they get every night is extrapolated to draw conclusions about larger groups of voters.I', u'In 2012, the Obama campaign was doing 10,000 of these ID calls a night, which worked out to 1,000 responses in each of the 10 battleground states. ', u'These calls don t go out to random voters. ', u'The IDs must get responses from a certain number of voters who are representative of a few different categories or voter score ranges, so that their responses can be used to update the larger categories.I', u'It s unclear how much of a challenge the Trump campaign s shotgun marriage with the Republican National Committee has affected its ability to synchronize and tailor messaging state by state. ', u'Trump has had a data operation, but it has seen turnover, with one data director, Matt Braynard, leaving early last summer. ', u'He was replaced by Witold Chrabaszcz, a former RNC staffer.I', u'If the RNC is trying to use data from Trump businesses or volunteers not using the national party s data, that could make it harder for the joint RNC/Trump effort to make sure the campaign s TV ads, digital content, voter scripts and surrogate messaging are all on the same page. ', u'The Clinton campaign tested this kind of coordination during the primary and is fine-tuning that experience now. ', u'This kind of precision messaging also helps ensure that the Clinton campaign is not sending messages to voters that might have a negative impact on other elections in key states, like close battleground races for the U.S. ', u'At one point over the summer, Trump s travel to nonbattleground states flummoxed many observers and supporters, and was clear evidence that his campaign was not using any kind of data-backed analytics to guide internal decision making about where to send him. ', u'But RNC officials say that has changed, and there is now a weekly meeting to review fresh data and use it to shape upcoming travel.E', u'Even with that, however, the Trump campaign does not have the kind of manpower directing resources that Mitt Romney s campaign did in 2012. ', u'With any traditional candidate,  you d have a 50- or 60-person operation at the campaigns directing strategy and guiding where resources need to be spent,  said Mark Stephenson, a Republican operative who oversaw the data and analytics operation for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker s presidential campaign.E', u'Early voting is another area where data and analytics play a crucial role. ', u'The voter universes built by the Clinton campaign and the RNC will help them understand who is voting early and who is not. ', u'They ll know, then, whether they are losing or winning a state well in advance of Election Day, and that will dictate how much money they spend on TV there, how often their candidate travels there, and who they try to contact to get them out to vote down the stretch.O', u'One of Clinton s big advantages appears to be in her precision in placing TV ads. ', u'Politico reported last month on an algorithm written by Clinton data analytics director Elan Kriegel to target TV ads in the primary, and Stephenson said his analysis of Kantar Media data shows that Clinton is getting far more bang for her buck on TV than Trump. ', u'Hillary is buying 50 or 60 channels, while Trump is only buying eight or nine. ', u'It points to a data-driven optimization,  Stephenson said. ', u'In other words, Clinton s campaign knows its voter universe well enough that it can place a certain type of ad on a rerun show like  Wheel of Fortune  because it knows it s going to hit a certain target audience and it will pay a bargain rate. ', u'Clinton s campaign has also maximized, as Obama did, advance purchasing of airtime to lock in lower rates.C', u'Clinton has already outspent Trump exponentially on the airwaves and through online advertising, and is projected to outpace him by a huge margin between now and Nov. 8.T', u'The only caveat to Clinton s advantage here is the effectiveness of TV ads in the modern media environment. ', u'Yet Clinton campaign officials said in private conversations that the election will be won over a  relatively small number of votes,  and they are maximizing every means of influencing those voters.D', u'Digital content distribution and digital advertising are another huge category, as is building an email list, which is key to raising small-dollar donations.T', u'Trump s digital director, Brad Parscale, has a team of RNC digital staffers headed by Gary Coby embedded in his San Antonio, Texas, offices doing the bulk of the campaign s digital advertising. ', u'The RNC also took over managing the entire 9 million person combined RNC and Trump campaign email list after Parscale hit a spam rate so high that there was risk of the campaign getting kicked off its email provider.K', u'Kriegel, Clinton s data director, said 2016 has been  interesting from a pure data perspective  because of Trump s unpredictability and the ways in which certain categories of voters have been tossed in the air and rearranged.F', u'For all the talk of Trump bringing new voters into politics to vote Republican, Kriegel said, he has seen statistical evidence that there are registered Democrats who have not been regular voters over the past few elections who have been roused in opposition to Trump and are more likely to vote now. ', u'But despite the volatility of the 2016 election, Kriegel expressed the kind of confidence about the shape of the electorate that s customary for the operatives who endlessly sift large data sets. ', u'I have a pretty good idea who is still deciding, who his core is, who our core is and who our new supporters are,  Kriegel said.  ']

[u'With Samsung still unable to identify the root cause behind Galaxy Note 7 units catching fire and exploding, the South Korean tech giant had no choice but to discontinue the product entirely earlier this week. ', u'What this means is that Samsung has permanently ceased all Note 7 production, will not be issuing replacement devices, and will not even attempt to repair affected devices. ', u'Driving the point home, Samsung earlier today confirmed that it will dispose of every single returned device.N', u'Now if you happen to still be a Note 7 owner, there are a few things you should know.

", u"As we covered yesterday, one Note 7 owner recently saw her device start to smoke wildly after an innocent visit to Samsung's own homepage.T", u"Two, you don't want to dispose of the device by yourself. ", u"After all, you don't want someone else to find it in the trash, turn it on and risk getting burned. ", u'Remember, Samsung by mid-September had already received upwards of 26 reports involving Note 7-related burns and upwards of 55 reports of the Note 7 causing serious property damage.T', u'That said, the U.S. ', u'Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recommends that users return the device to the wireless carrier or retail outlet where it was purchased and exchange it for another smartphone model.N', u'Notably, customers who opt to exchange the device for another Samsung smartphone model will be eligible for a $25 credit. ', u'Depending on where you purchased your Note 7, it may take as many as 2-3 billing cycles for the credit to appear on your statement.I', u"It's also worth noting that customers can also exchange any Note 7 accessories they may have purchased.A", u'According , some carriers will even provide users with a "loaner" device in certain circumstances. ', u'AT  will even give you a loaner phone if the phone you want, like an iPhone 7 Plus, is back-ordered. ', u'Not every carrier is doing this. ', u'T-Mobile told USA TODAY they were not doing a similar offer. ', u"We've reached out to Verizon and Sprint and will update this post once we hear back. ", u'Speaking of T-Mobile, the "uncarrier" has come out and said that they will "waive any restocking charges" and that customers who purchased the device as part of a pre-order promotion can "keep the free Netflix subscription and Gear Fit or SD card" they received.F', u'For anyone who ordered the Note 7 directly from Samsung, the company advises users to call 1-844-365-6197 for return instructions. ', u'More than likely, the company will send you a fireproof box in which to return the device.L', u'Lastly, Note 7 owners who simply want a refund instead of a smartphone exchange can receive all of their money back, whether or note they paid for the device up-front or were already making payments on an installment plan.T', u'Trending right now:']

[u'By Phil Stewart and Idrees AliWASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. ', u'Navy destroyer was targeted on Wednesday in a failed missile attack from territory in Yemen controlled by Iran-aligned Houthi rebels, the second such incident in four days, the U.S. military said.T', u'The USS Mason fired defensive salvos in response to at least one missile which did not hit the ship or caused any damage as it operated north of the Bab al-Mandab Strait, the Pentagon said.

[u'A few weeks ago, Brian Roemmele penned widely circulated post on Quora articulating a number of reasons why Apple\'s next-gen iPhone, a device likely to be called the iPhone 8, will be made out of "stunning ceramic." While specifically touting the mechanical strength and toughness of zirconium ceramics, Roemmele simultaneously relied upon a number of loosely connected patent filings from Apple to further justify his rather bold prediction."', u'"Zirconia ceramics exhibits the highest mechanical strength and toughness at room temperature," Roemmele explained. ', u'"Zirconium ceramics have the highest fracture toughness of any advanced technical ceramic. Its toughness, mechanical properties and corrosion resistance make it ideal for high pressure applications."On the surface, Roemmele\'s explanation is certainly compelling, especially since the last three iterations of the iPhone all, more or less, look and feel the same. ', u'That said, the idea of a new iPhone model made out of a completely novel and advanced material with space-age characteristics understandably got the Apple masses excited.F', u"For anyone out there who got excited about Apple's iPhone 8 being made out of ceramics, well, it's time to jump back to reality. ", u'In fact, you can probably bet good money that the iPhone 8 will assuredly not be made out of zirconia ceramics.E', u'Earlier this week, product designer Greg Koenig of Atomic Delights penned an incredibly detailed and straight-forward post explaining why the iPhone 8 will likely be made out of familiar materials. ', u'In short, any grand visions of a ceramic iPhone will have to be put on hold.B', u"Based on the manufacturing process Apple utilizes to produce the white ceramic Apple Watch -- as detailed in a booklet included within the wearable's packaging -- Koenig explains that it would be highly impractical if not downright foolish to assume that Apple could scale this same process over to the iPhone without anyone noticing. ", u'The process they describe is meticulously executed, and because of the nature of the design - wherein ceramics are mimicking the engineering layout of far more easily produced materials - probably the most laboriously produced ceramic watch on the market. ', u"In fact, if we scale the numbers used in the booklet up to iPhone size devices and cycle times, Apple would need 2 football field's worth of kiln space for each ceramic iPhone to sinter for the requisite 36 hours. ", u'For the 2 hours of hard ceramic machining to finish the case details, Apple would need to go from 20,000 CNC machines, to 250,000. ', u'They would need another 200,000 employees to perform the 2 hours of hand polishing to "bring out the strength and luster." More bluntly, not only is Apple not using any new ceramics manufacturing technology in the new Watch Edition, they are not even utilizing the primary patent the original Quora article pins most of it\'s extrapolations on - that patent described a vacuum liquid slurry casting process for ceramics. ', u'The Edition watch uses a very common pressed powder forming method. ', u'Additionally, the logistics involved in acquiring the requisite machinery in sufficient volume to mass produce tens of millions of ceramic iPhones would seemingly preclude the plan from getting off the ground in time for the iPhone 8."', u"All told, you should definitely read Koenig's full explanation, especially if you're the least bit interested in the advanced manufacturing processes and logistical considerations that go into mass producing a device as popular and widely distributed as the iPhone.T", u'Trending right now:']

[u'Her argument barely took flight before it started to wobble.T', u'The national spokesperson for Donald Trump s presidential campaign argued on Wednesday that Trump could not possibly have groped a woman aboard an airplane because seats in the first-class cabin had fixed armrests in the early 1980s.A', u'A CNN panel burst into laughter when Katrina Pierson, who has been with the Trump team since November 2015, invoked what critics have dubbed the  aviation defense. ', u'Panel moderator Don Lemon had asked Pierson if she believed Jessica Leeds  account of being sexually assaulted aboard a New York-bound airliner three decades ago. ', u'Leeds recently told the New York Times that Trump lifted his armrest, grabbed her breasts, and attempted to put his hand up her skirt when they sat next to each other in first class. ', u'I do not believe it at all. ', u'It is 100 percent, patently false and, as I was saying, this is the exact same New York Times that tried the same stunt back in March and then those women came forward and debunked that article,  Pierson responded.T', u'Then Pierson started discussing what kinds of airplanes were around when the alleged sexual assault occurred. ', u'She said that in the early  80s, the only commercial jet airliners available were the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, the McDonnell Douglas DC-10, the McDonnell Douglas MD-80, and perhaps the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. ', u'But, she continued, the flight was heading to New York, so Trump and Leeds couldn t have been aboard the DC-10 or the L-1011.T', u'Trump national spokesperson Katrina Pierson talks with delegates during the final day of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, July 21, 2016. (Photo: Carolyn Kaster/AP)Pierson said that the armrests for first-class passengers aboard all the remaining possible planes did not move and suggested that this would have somehow prevented Trump from being able to reach over to the passenger seated beside him. ', u'First-class seats have fixed armrests, so what I can tell you about her story is, if she was groped on a plane, it wasn t by Donald Trump and it certainly wasn t in first class,  she said. ', u'How could it happen? ', u'Pierson continued. ', u'Explain how that happens. ', u'There are fixed seats on first class. ', u'Phil Derner Jr., the founder of NYCAviation, a website for airplane enthusiasts, told Yahoo News that the aircraft types she mentioned flew into all New York City-area airports back then. ', u'Even larger aircraft like the DC-10 or the L-1011, as big as they were, did fly into what many would consider to be a smaller airport like LaGuardia,  Derner said. ', u'In fact, those aircraft types were built for smaller airports like LaGuardia. ', u'I don t fully understand where she got that information, but that is simply incorrect. ', u'He also said there were aircraft back then that had adjustable armrests, some in coach and some in first class. ', u'Some armrests did move,  he said.A', u'Amid laughter at Pierson s argument, Lemon said he would not argue with her about the type of plane because they did not have that information. ', u'I just gave you the options,  Pierson said, unperturbed.R', u'Robert J. Valli Jr. and James A. Vagnini, who are civil rights and employment discrimination attorneys in New York, said the armrest could be a relevant issue if Leeds brings her allegations against Trump to a court of law before the statute of limitations runs out. ', u'That would be an interesting defense as part of her testimony that an armrest was lifted in order to gain this access,  Valli said in a phone interview with Yahoo News. ', u'So the parties would be able to inspect the plane that was used at that time. ', u'There are different types of planes, different types of first-class structures. ', u'As a plaintiff, you d want to identify that plane   if not, the various options of planes that were available. ', u'Vagnini dismissed the notion that the armchair defense is a red herring, something that misleads from the issue at hand. ', u'I wouldn t call it a red herring. ', u'It would be a legitimate argument that a defense attorney would make in respect to a claim of sexual harassment,  he told Yahoo News. ', u'Four women accused Trump of sexual assault in various news stories published Wednesday night. ', u'Rachel Crooks told her story alongside Leeds for the Times piece; Natasha Stoynoff wrote about her encounter with Trump for People magazine; and Mindy McGillivray said in the Palm Beach Post that he groped her. ', u'Temple Taggart, a former Miss Utah, had already been on record with her allegations against Trump. ', u'The billionaire tycoon s behavior around women came under focus last week after a taped conversation of his bragging about how his celebrity status allowed him to  get away with  touching women s genitals. ', u'At the second presidential debate, Trump claimed that this was merely  locker-room talk  and  just words. ', u'Former beauty pageant queens in the Miss USA and Miss Universe competitions recently said that Trump would walk into their dressing room while some girls were topless or naked. ', u'A conversation Trump had with shock-jock Howard Stern in 2005 appears to confirm that allegation. ', u'After the Times article was published, Jason Miller, the senior communications adviser for the Trump campaign, released a statement accusing the paper of launching a false, coordinated character assassination against the candidate. ', u'To reach back decades in an attempt to smear Mr. Trump trivializes sexual assault, and it sets a new low for where the media is willing to go in its efforts to determine this election,  Miller wrote. ', u'It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged in this story, and for this to only become public decades later in the final month of a campaign for president should say it all.

[u"By Aleksandar VasovicPODGORICA (Reuters) - Montenegro's ruling party faces its toughest test in 27 years in power on Sunday, when it hopes its election promise to bring the country into NATO and closer to the European Union will outweigh opposition allegations of cronyism and corruption.T", u'The Western alliance invited the tiny Balkan country of 620,000 to join last year, partly out of concern at Russian influence in Montenegro, which has strong cultural and commercial links to its traditional Orthodox Christian ally.P', u'Prime Minister Milo Djukanovic, 54, presents the election as a choice between continuing Western integration under his Democratic Party of Socialists or being reduced to a "Russian colony" under the opposition."', u'"Do we want stable, prosperous and European Montenegro or will we be a country of backwardness, violence and hopelessness," Djukanovic asked supporters at a final rally on Thursday. ', u'"Will we be a Russian colony in the Balkans?"Djukanovic accuses opposition parties, some also pro-Western, of taking Russian money.B', u'Both they and Russia deny this.

', u'Ties with ethnic kin in neighboring Serbia remain strong.W', u'With few reliable polls in the country, the election is hard to call, but long-term allies have recently deserted Djukanovic, in an indication that the opposition message has traction.F', u"For Russia, Djukanovic told supporters, Sunday's parliamentary vote was Moscow's last chance to derail the Balkan region's wholesale rush towards NATO and EU membership, widely seen as the best prospect for stability and growth in a region that was wracked by war for much of the 1990s.T", u"The former Yugoslav republic's economy has grown at an average of 3.2 percent a year for the past decade, thanks mainly to foreign, especially Russian, investment in energy, mining and tourism in a country known for its spectacular mountains and sea coast.B", u"But opposition parties say organized crime has flourished on Djukanovic's watch.A", u'At an opposition rally in the capital Podgorica, hundreds of backers of the Democratic Front (DF), an alliance of pro-Serb and pro-Western parties, waved Serb, Russian and Montenegrin flags, chanting their campaign slogan "Us or Him.""Djukanovic, step down peacefully on Sunday if you love Montenegro ," said Nebojsa Medojevic, a pro-Western politician and one of DF leaders.V', u'Voting starts at 0500 GMT and closes at 1800 GMT.(Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic; Editing by Thomas Escritt/Jeremy Gaunt)']

", u'James Kirk, commanding officer of the Zumwalt, says it generates 78 megawatts of power, "enough power to power a medium- to small-sized city." With a motto of Pax Proctor Vim (Peace Through Power), it\'s unique capability to generate power could be used in ways perhaps not even envisioned yet, such as in the testing and use of laser and directed-energy weapon systems.M', u'MISSILESThe Zumwalt will be able to launch Tomahawk cruise missiles, Evolved Sea Sparrow Missiles, standard surface-to-air missiles and anti-submarine rockets from 80 missile tubes.R', u'RIDEThe Zumwalt also features an unconventional wave-piercing hull that makes its ride "very smooth," said Lt. Cmdr. Nate Chase.

[u'London (AFP) - With time running out for the besieged people of Aleppo and for a US administration with barely three months left on the clock, John Kerry is looking for new ideas.I', u"In two days of international talks over the weekend, Washington's chief diplomat continued to bang his well-worn drum for a renewed ceasefire in Syria's ugly conflict.B", u'But -- having hit a brick wall in efforts to convince Russia to help its US rival impose a ceasefire -- he made it clear that he wants other countries to play a bigger role.O', u"On Saturday in Lausanne, Syria's neighbours -- some of them enemies among themselves, others with their own agendas -- were brought back to the table and pumped for suggestions.T", u'Then on Sunday in London, US allies from Europe and the Gulf were pressured to come up with ideas of their own.T', u'Talk is of a new track, but very little concrete has emerged. ', u'As Syria\'s civilians face starvation and bombardment, world capitals are doing what Kerry dubbed "brainstorming".A', u'And the US diplomat did not hide his frustration at setting off once again down the track of finding a ceasefire plan that Russia and Syria would accept and implement.T', u'This plan will be put to the test -- "yet again, but in a different way, yet again"  - in order to find out whether it\'s possible to pause the fighting long enough for peace talks."', u'"Now, our job is to exhaust those possibilities. That\'s what we\'re trying to do," Kerry said, standing alongside a more ebullient British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.- Calls for action -Back in Washington, President Barack Obama has made no secret of his reluctance in his last weeks in office to commit US military power to the battle to destabilize Bashar al-Assad.B', u'But Russia has been no more coy about its determination to shore Assad up even to the extent that its war planes are engaged in the bombardment of rebel-held eastern Aleppo.S', u"Saturday's meeting in Switzerland brought together the powers which influence the armed factions, and ideas were floated to separate Al Qaeda-linked extremists from moderate groups.T", u"Then on Sunday, with the Europeans, Kerry discussed pressuring President Vladimir Putin and showing him that Russia's interests are best served by a ceasefire and peace talks.J", u'Johnson and Kerry both sharply played down the idea of military force, but both said new sanctions were possible and the British minister floated the idea of war crimes charges."', u'"These things will eventually come to bite the perpetrators of these crimes. And they should be thinking about it now," Johnson warned, bristling at reporters\' questions.K', u'Kerry too expressed frustration at calls for action."', u'"I haven\'t seen a big appetite in Europe for people to go to war. I don\'t see the parliaments of European countries ready to declare war," he told British reporters.- Mass grave - A', u'A secretly taped conversation released last month confirmed what had been widely assumed that Kerry had argued for US air strikes against Assad to give his diplomacy more bite. ', u'Obama rejected the plan, and Kerry threw himself into the search for an international negotiated solution. ', u'"So we are pursuing diplomacy because those are the tools that we have, and we\'re trying to find a way forward under those circumstances," he said on Sunday. ', u'"Easy to say, where\'s the action? But what is the action?" O', u"One day before Kerry's visit to Lausanne he had stood at the genocide memorial in the Rwandan capital Kigali and pondered a mass grave holding 250,000 of the victims of the 1994 genocide. ", u'A similar number of civilians and -- according to Johnson -- between 10,000 and 11,000 opposition fighters are trapped in eastern Aleppo facing daily indiscriminate bombardment. ', u'If they are to be saved, it seems to be out of American hands. ', u'And Johnson, having been asked for ideas, appealed to Assad and his "puppeteers" Russia and Iran to display one quality that has been lacking in Syria\'s five-year carnage. ', u'The British minister praised Kerry for his efforts to convince Moscow and Tehran to halt the bombing, but admitted: "It\'s really up to them now to listen and to show mercy."']

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   Hillary Clinton generally avoided direct criticism of Wall Street as she examined the causes and responses to the financial meltdown during a series of paid speeches to Goldman Sachs, according to transcripts disclosed Saturday by WikiLeaks.T', u"Three transcripts released as part of the hack of her campaign chairman's emails did not contain any new bombshells showing she was unduly influenced by contributions from the banking industry, as her primary rival Bernie Sanders had suggested. ", u'Still, her soft-handed approach in the speeches was likely to act as a reminder to liberals in the party of their concerns that the Democratic presidential nominee is too close to Wall Street to be an effective check on its excesses if elected.I', u'In October 2013, the transcripts show, Clinton told bankers she had "great relations" and worked closely with Wall Street as New York\'s senator, and said "the jury is still out" on whether the Dodd-Frank financial reforms put in place after the financial crisis had been the right approach. ', u'She said more openness from the start could have prevented the uproar on Wall Street over those reforms."', u'"What happened, how did it happen, how do we prevent it from happening? You guys help us figure it out, and let\'s make sure that we do it right this time," she said.W', u'Working to relate her speech to her audience, Clinton in one speech likened her experience as secretary of state to business and finance, saying "it\'s like anybody\'s balance sheet," with both opportunities and potential liabilities. ', u'In one exchange, a conference participant from Texas told Clinton that she had "the honor to raise money for you" during her 2008 presidential campaign.C', u'Clinton responded, "You are the smartest people."In the hard-fought Democratic primary, Sanders repeatedly called on Clinton to release the transcripts of her speeches to Wall Street, some of which earned her hundreds of thousands of dollars apiece. ', u'In an ironic twist, the transcripts ended up becoming public because her campaign aides had distributed them among themselves in an effort to prepare for any attacks she might face. ', u"Those internal campaign emails were then leaked in the hack of campaign chairman John Podesta's emails.C", u"Clinton's campaign neither confirmed nor denied that the speech transcripts and leaked Podesta emails are authentic, but there have been no indications that they were doctored before being released. ", u'Clinton\'s team has accused Russia\'s government of hacking Podesta\'s emails, and the Obama administration has formally blamed Moscow for a series of breaches affecting U.S. political groups."', u'"There is no getting around it: Donald Trump is cheering on a Russian attempt to influence our election through a crime reminiscent of Watergate, but on a more massive scale," said Clinton spokesman Glen Caplin.T', u'The transcripts, all from 2013, include speeches and question-and-answer sessions with Clinton at a "Builders and Innovators Summit," an "Alternative Investment Management Summit" and a gathering of CEOS   all hosted by Goldman Sachs.A', u'A look at some of what Clinton said, according to the transcripts:___APOLOGY TOURClinton told the innovators summit she\'d had to go on "The Clinton Apology Tour" after WikiLeaks in 2010 published diplomatic cables leaked by Chelsea Manning, formerly known as Bradley Manning. ', u'Clinton noted that the cables showed U.S. officials characterizing some foreign leaders as "vain, egotistical, power hungry, corrupt. And we knew they were. This was not fiction.""I had grown men cry," Clinton recalled. ', u'Clinton appears to call for eliminating the filibuster rules in the Senate that make a 60-vote threshold necessary to pass most items rather than a 50-vote majority. ', u'Clinton says "we need to change the rules in the Senate" and say presidential nominees as well as "policies" deserve "an up-or-down vote." R', u'Republicans are already incensed that Senate Democrats recently changed the rules to eliminate the filibuster for most nominations, an extraordinary step known as the nuclear option. __ C', u'In the June 2013 speech, Clinton said Chinese President Xi Jinping, who had taken over as the country\'s leader the previous fall, was "a more sophisticated, more effective public leader" than his predecessor, Hu Jintao. ', u'Clinton said she had watched Xi "work a room," adding, "you can have him make small talk with you, which he has done with me." She said Xi\'s experience of visiting Iowa in the 1980s "was a very important part of his own development." ___ A', u'Associated Press writer Jack Gillum contributed to this report.

[u'President Obama is experiencing some of the highest approval ratings of his presidency, in part because he is rightly considered to be the antithesis of Trump. ', u'Much the same can be said for the first lady, who is benefitting from the contrast to Trump s degrading, even deranged campaign. ', u'Nonetheless, it s also true that from her first days in the White House, Michelle Obama demonstrated a potent combination of dignity and decency, and her policy initiatives reflect her values.H', u'Her  Let s Move!  campaign combatting childhood obesity, her advocacy for military families, and her work on behalf of women s rights and access to higher education for young people have been aimed at improving the lives of vulnerable populations. ', u'Michelle Obama has also managed to articulate the fears and, crucially, embody the hopes felt by millions of Americans. ', u'Coming across in the tradition of Eleanor Roosevelt, she has communicated her worries as a mother who understands the pain and daily concerns of ordinary Americans who have come to identify with the woman who is living in the White House. ', u'In her widely praised 2016 convention address, she candidly described the challenge of watching her young daughters go off to school  into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns. ', u'And I saw their little faces pressed up against the window, and the only thing I could think was,  What have we done? ', u'See, because at that moment, I realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how well we managed this experience could truly make or break them. ', u'This bond with the public has been built, as Curtin observes, over time. ', u'Moreover, as Muncy points out, Michelle Obama s  when they go low, we go high  line is  setting a standard for all political activists baffled and shaken by the shocking, indeed downright depraved, level of so much current political rhetoric. ', u'She is an antiracist feminist leader of the first rank, a leader who understands how racial justice, gender justice, environmentalism and nutrition, for instance, are all connected. ', u'Michelle Obama has also insisted that her faith in America, despite its imperfections, remains unbroken. ', u'She has invoked the tradition of the suffrage movement, the civil rights movement and other movements that have sought to hold the nation to the standard set forth in the declaration that all people  are created equal. ', u'For instance, she was also able to respond to the onslaught of racist attacks on the nation s first African-American president with grace and dignity. ', u'Every day, she said at this year s Democratic convention,  we try to guide and protect our girls through the challenges of this unusual life in the spotlight   how we urge them to ignore those who question their father s citizenship or faith. ', u'How we insist that the hateful language they hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. ', u'How we explain that when someone is cruel, or acts like a bully, you don t stoop to their level. ', u'Her own story, along with the causes and people she has championed, is yoked to American ideals of social equality, individual worth and expansive notions of rights and opportunity and has won over a sizable majority of the public.M', u'Most of this year s campaign hasn t been focused on Michelle Obama, of course. ', u'Rather, it has been consumed with coverage of Donald Trump s derogatory comments toward women, people of color and the disabled (to name a few of his favorite targets). ', u'Trump has caused progressives (and some conservatives) to despair that in 2016 the country has moved backward, into a darker time. ', u'Such despondency, however, has been offset to a degree by the demonstration of wisdom, equality and decency exemplified by Michelle Obama. ', u'The first lady has championed social equality and ultimately made the United States more keenly aware of its legacies of gender and racial discrimination. ', u'America is more just in 2016 than it was before she became first lady.F', u'First lady Michelle Obama speaks while hosting a special screening with the U.S. ', u'Department of State s Office of Global Women s Issues at the White House.

[u'A 10th woman has come forward to accuse Donald Trump of sexual misconduct.C', u'Cathy Heller told the Guardian that during her first and only meeting with Donald Trump approximately 20 years ago, the businessman grabbed her and attempted a kiss, from which she recoiled. ', u'Visibly irritated, Heller claims, Trump snapped,  Oh, come on,  held her still, and forcibly kissed her on the lips. ', u'He kept me there for a little too long,  Heller, now 63, said of the incident, which she claims took place during a Mother s Day brunch at Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate. ', u'And then he just walked away. ', u'Heller s story is an increasingly familiar one. ', u'Not only does it echo those of several other women who ve accused the Republican presidential nominee of unwanted groping, kissing and other sexual advances, like the others, her account also seems to corroborate Trump s own description of how he treats women, as recently revealed by a recording from 2005.A', u'And like many of the women who ve come forward in recent days, Heller says she was motivated to share her story after Sunday s presidential debate, during which Trump publicly denied having engaged in the behavior he described in the 2005 video.T', u'Trump and members of his campaign team have vehemently denied the accusations that surfaced in the wake of the latest debate, suggesting that based on the timing, the women who ve come forward this week must be part of a conspiracy aimed at derailing Trump s presidential campaign involving Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and the mainstream news media.H', u'Heller s claims come in the wake of a Friday afternoon press conference in which former  Apprentice  contestant Summer Zervos, with the help of famed civil rights attorney Gloria Allred, alleged that she, too, had been forcibly groped and kissed by Trump years ago.L', u'Late Friday, the Trump campaign attempted to discredit Zervos by releasing a statement from one of her cousins, who said he was  shocked and bewildered  by the story, suggesting that Zervos simply  wishes she could still be on reality TV  and her account is  nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump s expense. ', u'A little over an hour after Heller s story was published on the Guardian s website, Trump reiterated his blanket denial of the actions he s been accused of by 10 women and counting. ', u'Nothing ever happened with any of these women. ', u'Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. ', u'Nobody has more respect for women than me! ', u'Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 15, 2016 Later Saturday afternoon, the Trump campaign issued an official response to the Guardian story, arguing that,  There is no way that something like this would have happened in a public place on Mother s Day at Mr. Trump s resort. ', u'It would have been the talk of Palm Beach for the past two decades. ', u'The Guardian spoke to several friends and relatives of Heller s who corroborated the story that they say she s been sharing with those close to her for more than a year. ', u'In fact, according to the story published Saturday, Heller first told a Guardian reporter about her encounter with Trump back in February but at the time chose not to speak on the record. ', u'He said this is just talk, but it s not just talk,  Heller said, explaining why she s chosen to speak up now. ', u'This was him. ']

', u'In smartphones, Apple wields extensive influence and often secures exclusive rights to certain parts from suppliers. ', u'For cars, the heavy investment required to make automotive parts means suppliers are less willing to commit their products to a vehicle like Apple s which may have initially shipped in small quantities.

', u'The company is built on the idea of closed architecture, where it tightly controls everything from the design of the device to every line of code on it, and you can only play in its walled garden if you abide by its rules. ', u'Apple is so dedicated to this idea that when they cut their headphone jack from the iPhone 7, their first argument was that their philosophy of closed architecture made them innovators.A', u'Apple isn t going anywhere. iPhones and their accessories are selling briskly and they ve got enormous cash reserves they ve invested long-term to keep the company going. ', u'And Apple is exploring unusual new areas that are likely to pay off. ', u'But Apple has also been here before, where it innovated and opened up new markets and then struggled as competitors out-innovated and outpriced them.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   A senior State Department official asked the FBI last year to help reduce the classification of an email from Hillary Clinton's private server, according to FBI investigative files made public Monday.

[u'The Federal Communications Commission announced on Wednesday that T-Mobile will pay out $48 million to settle a dispute over "unlimited" data plans that aren\'t so unlimited. $7.5 million of that will be paid as a fine to the FCC, while the rest will be "consumer benefits" offered to T-Mobile customers with unlimited plans. $5 million is also being kicked in as equipment for American schools.T', u'The complaints are specifically related to T-Mobile\'s practice of "de-prioritizing" -- a nice way of saying "throttling" -- heavy data users during times of network congestion.

[u'By Steve Holland and Amanda BeckerLAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump said on Wednesday he might reject the outcome of the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election if he loses, an unprecedented challenge to a cornerstone of American democracy.D', u'During the last of three debates against his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, Trump was asked by moderator Chris Wallace whether this meant the New York businessman would not commit to a peaceful transition of power."', u'"What I\'m saying is that I will tell you at the time. I\'ll keep you in suspense. Ok?" Trump replied.C', u'Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, said Trump\'s comment was "horrifying.""That is not the way our democracy works," she said. ', u'"We\'ve been around for 240 years. We\'ve had free and fair elections. We\'ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them. And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election."In a debate that for the first time focused more on policy than character, the two candidates nonetheless lashed out at each other.T', u'Trump, 70, called Clinton "such a nasty woman," accused her campaign of orchestrating a series of accusations by women who said the businessman made unwanted sexual advances and said that both she and President Barack Obama were behind disturbances at his rallies. ', u'He said the Clinton Foundation was a criminal enterprise and as a result she should not have been allowed to seek the presidency.C', u'Clinton, 68, said Trump himself had incited violence, belittled women and posed a danger to the United States.

He called the Clinton campaign "sleazy" and said, "Nobody has more respect for women than I do, nobody."Clinton said the women came forward after Trump said in the last debate he had never made unwanted advances on women. ', u'In a 2005 video, Trump was recorded bragging about groping women against their will."', u'"Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger. He goes after their dignity, their self-worth and I don t think there is a woman anywhere who doesn t know what that feels like," said Clinton, the first woman to win the nomination of a major U.S. political party.C', u'Clinton, the first woman to win the presidential nomination of a major U.S. political party, said Trump had maligned many different groups."', u'"This is a pattern. A pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies. That is not who America is," she said.F', u'FADING IN POLLSTrump entered the debate hoping to reverse opinion polls tilting away from him. ', u'Trump has raised concerns by claiming the election will be rigged against him, and has urged supporters to patrol polling places in inner cities to prevent voter fraud.T', u'The two presidential rivals had tough but issues-based exchanges on abortion, gun rights and immigration during the 90-minute showdown, but occasionally reacted angrily. ', u"Clinton said she would raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund the U.S. government's Social Security retirement program, but suggested Trump might try to find a way out of paying the higher taxes. ", u'It was then that Trump asserted Clinton was "such a nasty woman." M', u"Mexico's peso currency, seen as a measure of Trump's prospects, firmed to its highest level in six weeks at the end of the debate, suggesting growing investor confidence of a Clinton victory. ", u'Trump has vowed to build a wall on the border with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants and has said he would make Mexico pay for it. ', u'A CNN snap poll said 52 percent thought Clinton won the debate while 39 percent said Trump was the victor. ', u"Trump and Clinton battled sharply over the influence of Vladimir Putin, with Clinton calling Trump the Russian president's puppet and Trump charging Putin had repeatedly outsmarted Clinton. ", u'Clinton and Trump walked straight to their podiums when they were introduced at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, once again forgoing the traditional handshake as they did at the second debate last week in St. ', u'Louis, Missouri. ', u'This time they did not shake hands at the end of the debate either.

[u'One of the early clashes between the candidates in the final debate was over so-called partial-birth abortion   an abortion procedure that is sometimes performed later in pregnancy that Hillary Clinton has said should remain legal and that Donald Trump opposes.A', u'After saying he would appoint pro-life justices to the Supreme Court on the assumption that they would overturn Roe v.

', u'You can say that that s OK and Hillary can say that that s OK, but that s not OK with me. ', u'Clinton responded that this was a misinterpretation of how late-term abortion works. ', u'Late-term abortion is not used as a whim or as birth control late in pregnancy, but rather is a choice of last resort for women who  toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news they can get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term, or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy. ', u'In those cases, she said, where a live, healthy birth is not possible, or the life or health of the mother is at stake,  I do not think the government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions.

[u"QUITO, Ecuador (AP)   WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is finding himself in open conflict with his Ecuadorean protectors as the group's latest dump targeting Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign runs afoul of the South American government's goal of warming up to Washington.E", u"Ecuador's move to cut off his internet access at its embassy in London was a stinging rebuke from leftist President Rafael Correa, who in 2012 heralded Assange as a digital-age Robin Hood and granted him asylum over protests from the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden, where he faces allegations of rape.C", u"Correa's government said Tuesday that WikiLeaks' publication of a trove of damaging emails from Clinton's campaign had impacted the U.S. election in violation of Ecuador's traditional respect for other nations' sovereignty.A", u'Analysts say Correa is unlikely to now kick Assange out into the streets of London where he faces certain arrest. ', u'But allowing him to keep leaking secrets from the embassy risks putting the small Andean nation unwittingly on Russia\'s side of a brewing cyber-battle with the United States, Ecuador\'s top trade partner, at a time of deep economic stress."', u'"Before, the costs for Ecuador of hosting Assange were minor," said Santiago Basabe, a political analyst at the Latin American School of Social Sciences in Quito. ', u'"But they are growing bigger now because they involve questions of U.S. national security, its tense relations with Russia and the presidential elections."The cascade of disclosures of Democratic operatives\' hacked emails, including this week\'s publication of Clinton\'s speeches to Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs, has been hailed by Republican candidate Donald Trump as evidence of his rival\'s dishonesty. ', u"However, U.S. intelligence agents say the hack is the work of the Kremlin, although it's not clear how the files ended up with WikiLeaks.R", u'Regardless, Ecuador has plenty of reasons to try to curry favor with Washington.T', u'The oil-dependent, dollarized economy is fighting a recession made worse by low crude prices, a destructive earthquake in April and a strong U.S. dollar. ', u"Adding to the uncertainty is Correa's imminent departure from office after a decade in power that provided a sense of stability after years of coups and revolving-door presidencies.A", u"Analysts say whoever wins February's election   Correa's preferred successor currently leads polls   is almost certain to turn to the International Monetary Fund for a bailout. ", u'In such a scenario the support of the Washington, the biggest shareholder in the IMF, will be key in determining how severe an austerity program is required."', u'"Assange has inserted Ecuador in the U.S. presidential campaign and exposed it to retaliation in case Clinton wins," said former Foreign Minister Mauricio Gandara, adding that the publication of stolen documents is considered a crime in Ecuador.C', u'Correa, who in 2009 closed the only U.S. military base in South America and two years later expelled the U.S. ambassador, still peppers his speeches with anti-Yankee harangues in the mold of the late Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.B', u'But with Venezuela in economic freefall and ideological allies losing power in countries like Argentina and Brazil, Correa has quietly extended an olive branch to the Obama administration and sought to deepen commercial ties. ', u"This week he's hosting a U.S. trade delegation.C", u'Correa also praised Clinton in an interview last month with Moscow-based broadcaster RT."', u'"For the good of the United States and the world, and for my personal appreciation of her, I\'d like to see Hillary win," he said.T', u'Tensions between Assange and his hosts have surfaced before.

', u'More recently, though, Trump has criticized the program for putting Americans out of work. ', u"To wit, the following statement was published on Trump's website a few months ago. ", u'The H-1B program is neither high-skilled nor immigration: these are temporary foreign workers, imported from abroad, for the explicit purpose of substituting for American workers at lower pay. ', u'I remain totally committed to eliminating rampant, widespread H-1B abuse and ending outrageous practices such as those that occurred at Disney in Florida when Americans were forced to train their foreign replacements. ', u'I will end forever the use of the H-1B as a cheap labor program, and institute an absolute requirement to hire American workers first for every visa and immigration program. ', u'No exceptions. ', u"Trump didn't know how to turn a computer on in 1997 O", u"Okay, maybe we're being too harsh here because, truth be told, many people who were Trump's age when the Internet burst onto the scene in the mid-90s weren't exactly computer savvy. ", u"Still, we just couldn't pass up excerpt from Trump's 1997 book The Art of the Comeback:  ", u"Today the computer and technology industries are hot, but that doesn't mean that they won't cool off quickly. ", u'It just seems to me that they are overheated, and competition is strong. ', u'When I read about all of the different companies producing new computers by the thousands, it seems like a very tough business to me. ', u"But then, I don't even know how to turn on a computer.

[u'MIAMI (AP)   President Barack Obama on Thursday defended his namesake health care program, long a target of Republicans and recently criticized by some Democrats, saying millions of Americans "now know the financial security of health insurance" because of the Affordable Care Act."', u'"It\'s worked," he said, even while allowing that the program isn\'t perfect. ', u'"No law is."Less than two weeks before the Nov. 1 start of the enrollment period for Affordable Care Act health plans, Obama flew to a south Florida college to kick off a push by the administration to encourage more people to sign up, with a particular emphasis on young adults.O', u'Obama is trying to burnish his legacy as the president who, after decades of failed attempts by Washington, finally brought health care to millions.

', u'"But you don\'t go back to using a rotary phone. You don\'t say, we\'re repealing smartphones."Insurers say most of those who signed up for coverage since the law took effect turned out to be sicker than expected, which is costing them money.

[u"If you're shopping for a smartwatch, there's little reason to pick the recently launched Apple Watch Series 1 over the original model introduced in 2014. ", u"That's my conclusion after using the new and old versions of the watch side by side for several weeks.A", u'Apple announced a new lineup of smartwatches in September, alongside the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus and wireless headphones. ', u'The flagship watch is the Series 2 Apple Watch, which starts at $350 and has built-in GPS capabilities and swimproof construction. ', u'But the company also introduced a watch called the Series 1. ', u'It looks nearly identical to the original Watch, but has the faster processor that also appears in the Series 2.T', u'The Series 1 devices, which start at $270, were pitched as a good choice for someone who wants a less expensive alternative to the Series 2.B', u'But the first-generation Apple Watch is still an option, at least if you go shopping soon.

', u"We've seen prices as low as $190.A", u'Adding to its value, the original Apple Watch comes with a standard wall charger worth $20, while the Series 1 package includes a charging cable without a way to plug it into an outlet. (No, really. We triple-checked.)Of course, you might be willing to pay more if the old Watch was significantly outperformed by the new Series 1.A', u"Apple says that the new watch's dual-core processor will help speed up performance and cut down app load times.

[u'Clever detective work involving research on both ancient DNA and cave paintings from the last ice age has revealed a previously unknown species of hybrid bison, according to a new study.R', u'Researchers initially nicknamed the newfound bison the "Higgs Bison," because, just like the once-elusive subatomic particle known as the Higgs Boson, the bison\'s very existence had never been confirmed, and it took about 15 years to piece together data that proved its existence.B', u'But the newfound hybrid bison did quite well for itself and its descendants, the modern-day European bison (Bison bonasus), which is also known as a wisent. ', u'The European bison are still alive today, he said.T', u'The Aurochs (Bos primigenius) and bison (Bison priscus) are "genetically quite different," Cooper told Live Science. ', u'"[But they] produced something that was successful enough to carve out a niche on the landscape and go on to become, ironically, the biggest species [of other large animals] to survive the extinction at the end of the ice age in Europe."In addition, the discovery of the hybrid shows that the steppe bison, which was once thought to be the only bison in that region during the last ice age, likely competed with the hybrid species for tens of thousands of years, Cooper said.H', u"Hybrid mysteryTo solve the animal's mysterious genetic background, an international team of researchers examined the creature's remains   that is, its bones and teeth   which were unearthed from caves in Europe, the Ural mountains in Russia and the Caucasus mountains in Eurasia.T", u'Then, the scientists studied ancient DNA from 64 different bison, including the creature\'s mitochondrial DNA (genetic material passed down through the mother\'s lineage) and nuclear DNA, or DNA passed down from both parents."', u'"We could see that the nuclear DNA was very obviously like the steppe bison," Cooper said. ', u'"The mitochondrial [was] telling us another [ancestor]: cattle."The evidence suggested that the creature was a hybrid, likely started by a female Aurochs and a male steppe bison, he said. ', u'Moreover, the hybrid animal\'s nuclear DNA was about 90 percent steppe bison and 10 percent Aurochs, Cooper said."', u'"That ratio tells you that after the first hybridization event, there was back breeding with steppe bison for a little while, which is why the steppe bison DNA is higher," Cooper said. ', u'"That will often happen when you have a hybrid mammal, because the male [hybrid] offspring tend to be sterile." [Real or Fake? 8 Bizarre Hybrid Animals]Cave paintingsHowever, the researchers have yet to find a hybrid skull, meaning they can\'t truly assess what it looked like and what it ate.

Because we have [discovered] a second species," Cooper recalled. ', u'"They said, \'Ah, at last! Someone finally believes us. We\'ve been telling our colleagues for years that there are two forms of bison in the cave,\' which had been previously explained as artistic or cultural or stylistic differences."One form depicted a bison with either long horns or large forequarters, much like the American bison, which is descended from the steppe bison.

', u'Some of the paintings the researchers examined were made 18,000 years ago, and depicted creatures with long horns and large forequarters that likely descended from the steppe bison.

', u'Creative CommonsIn an unexpected turn, the dates of the drawings, some of them 18,000 years old, matched the ages of the radiocarbon-dated bison bones, the researchers added."', u'"The dated bones revealed that our new species and the steppe bison swapped dominance in Europe several times, in concert with major environmental changes caused by climate change," study lead author Julien Soubrier, a postdoctoral research associate in the genetics and evolution unit at the University of Adelaide, said in a statement.I', u'In other words, ancient people drew the hybrid bison when it was thriving during colder, tundra-like periods without warm summers, and they drew the steppe bison when it thrived during different climates (which have yet to be determined), Cooper said.

[u'The looming threat of earthquakes is nothing new for Californians. ', u'But a new discovery in the heart of the San Francisco bay has upped the risk of a historically disastrous quake.A', u'A team of geologists led by Janet Watt at the United States Geological Survey just made the unfortunate discovery underneath the murky waters of the San Francisco Bay: a hidden connection between two earthquake fault zones. ', u'The scientists outline their discovery today in the journal Science Advances. ', u'"The longer a fault stretches, the bigger the earthquake it can produce. And here we\'ve just doubled the length of this fault." "That\'s a big deal," says David Ponce, a geologist with the research group. ', u'They reach from the wine country northwest of the bay, continue under the bay waters directly into Oakland in the east bay, and terminate just north of San Jose. ', u"Watt and her team estimate that when this connected fault next slips, it could produce untold disaster: Up to a magnitude 7.4 earthquake, which would be California's 5th largest earthquake and very likely its most deadly. ", u'And it could happen soon; Ponce says there\'s a 32 percent chance such a quake could occur in the next 30 years."', u'"You have to understand that there are over 2.4 million people living right along this fault, and the population of this whole area is around 7.5 million. It also turns out that major transportation, gas, water and electrical lines cross this fault. So when it goes, it\'s going to be absolutely disastrous," Ponce says.H', u'How could this new chunk of fault line remain hidden for so long under such a highly populous region? ', u'"You have to understand that there are over 2.4 million people living right along this fault." One big reason is that the traditional tools and methods used to discover fault-zones underwater have been stymied by the San Francisco Bay\'s mud. ', u'Geologists typically use sound-waves to ping and probe underwater, collecting data about what lies under the sea floor. ', u'But San Pablo Bay-the northern section of the greater San Francisco Bay that conceals this fault line-is heavily layered with mud containing tiny pockets of gas. ', u'That gassy mud deflects sound-waves and makes it exceedingly hard to probe deep into the rock where the fault zone would lie.T', u'To bypass this issue, Watt and her colleagues used a fairly ingenious trick of deduction. ', u'They just looked for clues in the mud itself.U', u'Using a boat-towed soundwave tool called a chirp subbottom profiler, the geologists put together a map of the various mud layers in the bay. ', u'The scientists found that the layers of mud themselves were offset, suggesting a fissure in the rock below.T', u'The scientists also compared their mud data to a map of the magnetic properties of the bay floor. ', u"According to Ponce, because rocks at different layers in the Earth have different magnetic properties, a shift in the layers of rock below the earth's surface should be detectable. ", u'Just as expected, a weird magnetic anomaly clued the scientists in to the fact that the rocks below were-just like the mud-also offset. ', u'The fault-zone was found.F', u'For residents of the San Francisco Bay Area, Ponce says the takeaway from this new discovery is clear. ', u'"Everyone in this region should be prepared for an earthquake along this fault," he says. ', u'A potential 7.4 magnitude quake with such a high risk of occurring soon is no laughing matter."', u'"It will impact communities on both sides of the bay and there\'s going to be significant damage. So folks should do the standard things, like make sure you have food, supplies, and water for a couple of days, make sure you have a contact person to call, make sure your house is bolted to the foundation, and that your water heater is properly secured," he says.Y', u'You Might Also Like']

', u'But, he continued, since he began running for president,  Now they think I m a no-good rotten disgusting scoundrel. ', u'It wasn t a joke. ', u'It was Trump s lifelong bitterness over the ridicule he s endured from the New York elites who have never accepted him.W', u'With the crowd confused, Trump moved along to a few light jokes aimed at his opponent    I m sure Hillary is going to laugh a lot tonight. ', u'Maybe even at an appropriate moment. ', u'Another line got a huge laugh from the crowd, including Clinton herself    I bumped into Hillary backstage and she said,  Pardon me. ', u'But it would have been funnier if he hadn t threatened to put her in jail during their second debate.T', u'Trump didn t dabble much in self-deprecating humor, though that s traditionally been the norm at previous Al Smith Dinners. ', u'He did, however, deliver one jibe at the expense of his wife, admitting that she didn t know about it in advance    Michelle [Obama] gives a speech and everyone loves it, it s fantastic. ', u'My wife, Melania, gives the exact same speech and people get on her case. ', u'And then the evening went off the rails. ', u'Dropping the pretense of humor, Trump began lobbing attack lines from his campaign rallies, calling Clinton  so corrupt   so corrupt   she was fired from the Watergate committee. ', u'On the dais behind him, the eyes of dinner guests bulged and to his left, Clinton, who had been gamely playing along with a broad smile and laugh, froze.T', u'The crowd began booing, an almost unheard-of occurrence at these generally clubby dinners. ', u'Jimmy Carter found himself booed when he appeared with Ronald Reagan in 1980, but that was based on policy differences. ', u'Conservative Catholics who thought the evangelical Carter would be a fellow abortion opponent when he was elected in 1976 had lost faith in him after four years in the White House and were further angered by his White House conference on families, which they saw as threatening the definition and structure of traditional families.W', u'When Trump brought up WikiLeaks, the boos and hisses increased in volume and he stopped to acknowledge them. ', u'I don t know who they re angry at,  he said, turning to Clinton. ', u'You or I.  From the audience, someone hollered  You! ', u'Undeterred, Trump continued, saying of Clinton:  Here she is now in public, pretending not to hate Catholics. ', u'Nothing underscored the unprecedented nature of Trump s performance than the stony face of Cardinal Dolan, who at one point during the GOP nominee s remarks sat with his chin in his hand, and didn t applaud even when Trump closed by praising the dinner s charitable purpose.C', u'Clinton s turn at the podium was less awkward but her barbs were still more cutting than those of past candidates. ', u'She delivered the inevitable pantsuit joke, and acknowledged that she s not seen as the life of the party. ', u'The closest she got to addressing Trump s women problems was a joke about the Statue of Liberty    Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty, and sees a 4. ', u'The few burns she let loose were scorchers. ', u'Pointing out Michael Bloomberg on the dais, Clinton said,  It s a shame he isn t speaking tonight. ', u'I m curious to hear what a billionaire has to say. ', u'And noting that Trump suggested she be drug-tested before the final debate, she joked,  I am so flattered that Donald thought I used some sort of performance enhancer. ', u'Now actually, I did. ', u'It s called preparation. ', u'The crowd seemed more at ease with Clinton, groaning only when she suggested that Trump was the horse Vladimir Putin famously rides. ', u'And Trump appeared to take the ribbing mostly in stride, smiling occasionally. ', u'But the tension of this long, bitter, ugly campaign permeated the event. ', u'The two opponents did not shake hands when they entered the ballroom, although they did exchange a few words during dinner. ', u'And it was unclear until last week if both candidates would in fact attend.C', u'Clinton got the last word, camouflaging a few of her toughest jabs in a more somber closing reflection on the history of Catholics in America. ', u'There are a lot of people in this room tonight who themselves or their parents or grandparents came here as immigrants,  she said before touching on the anti-Catholicism they faced and that dogged Smith s presidential campaign. ', u'Those appeals to fear and division can cause us to treat each other as the other,  she continued. ', u'Rhetoric like that makes it harder for us to see each other, to respect each other, to listen to each other, and certainly a lot harder to love our neighbor as ourself. ']

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   The annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a white-tie gala in New York that is often the last time the two presidential nominees share a stage before Election Day, is traditionally a time when campaign hostilities are set aside.N', u'Not this year.D', u'Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton traded sharp barbs and brutal takedowns Thursday, the night after their final debate, with many in the well-heeled crowd turning on the Republican nominee midway through his remarks and showering him with jeers.T', u'Trump, who had drawn big laughs earlier in the speech, appeared to lose the room as he repeatedly dug in with caustic swipes at Clinton, drawing rare boos at a charity event meant to raise money for impoverished children throughout New York.H', u'He appeared to straddle the line when he talked about how "listening to Hillary rattle on and rattle on" has made him better appreciate his longtime nemesis Rosie O\'Donnell. ', u'But he then seemed to cross it when he referred to her as "corrupt" during a lengthy riff on the FBI\'s investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state."', u'"Hillary is so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission. How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission? Pretty corrupt," he said to loud boos and at least one call demanding he get off the stage.H', u'He then almost appeared to segue into the standard attack lines of his rally speeches, setting aside jokes to bring up material contained in hacked Clinton campaign emails."', u'"Hillary believes that it\'s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private," he said to growing jeers. ', u'"Here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics."Clinton also veered into personal digs, making one joke in which she said the Statue of Liberty, for most Americans, represents a symbol of hope for immigrants."', u'"Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a \'4,\'" Clinton joked. ', u'"Maybe a \'5\' if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair."Trump and Clinton sat one seat apart for the evening, with New York\'s Cardinal Timothy Dolan acting as the only buffer. ', u'And when they entered and took their seats, they did not greet each other or make eye contact, though they did shake hands at the conclusion of the roast.D', u'Dolan later called his seat "the iciest place on the planet."Most eyes were on Trump, who infamously glowered through Obama\'s jokes at his expense during the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner and is not known for being self-deprecating.S', u'Some of his jokes landed well, drawing laughs from both the crowd and Clinton.H', u'His biggest laughs came as he talked about Michelle Obama getting rave reviews for a recent speech. ', u'"They think she\'s absolutely great. My wife Melania gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case," he said to whoops and laughs.A', u'And some of his attack lines flashed a sense of humor that has been mostly absent from the grueling campaign. ', u'Clinton was the first one to laugh when Trump joked that she had bumped into him earlier in the night "and she very simply said \'Pardon me\'"   an unsubtle reference to the Republican nominee\'s frequent declarations that his opponent should go to jail.C', u'Clinton, meanwhile, was more self-deprecating than Trump, joking that she\'s taken a break from her "usual nap schedule" to attend and suggesting that the audience should be pleased she\'s not charging her usual fee for speaking in front of potential donors.B', u'But she also got in some digs at Trump, a few of which drew scattered jeers. ', u'Clinton said she understood why Trump was leery of teleprompters because they can be difficult to follow and "I\'m sure it\'s even harder when you\'re translating from the original Russian."The dinner is named after the former New York governor, who was the first Catholic to receive a major party nomination for president when he unsuccessfully ran in 1928. ', u'And fittingly for an event named after a man nicknamed "The Happy Warrior," the occasion has produced dozens of memorable presidential jokes   and sincere moments of goodwill that have remained largely absent from the 2016 campaign.

[u'MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP)   Calling it "dangerous," President Barack Obama said Thursday that Donald Trump\'s attempt to "sow the seeds of doubt" about the integrity of elections in America undermines U.S. democracy and does the work of the nation\'s adversaries."', u'"That is not a joking matter," Obama said at a campaign rally for Trump\'s rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.D', u"During the final presidential debate with Clinton on Wednesday night, the Republican candidate refused to say whether he would follow years of tradition and concede if he doesn't win the White House on Nov. 8. ", u'He has laid the groundwork by complaining for weeks that the system is "rigged" against him and in favor of Clinton, a former first lady, former U.S. senator and former secretary of state."', u'"I will tell you at the time. I\'ll keep you in suspense," Trump said.

', u'"He doesn\'t even worry if what he says is true. This is just about him worried that he\'s losing, which means he really doesn\'t have what it takes to hold this job."He said Trump didn\'t offer a "shred of evidence" to prove rigging or fraud, and called the claim "more than just the usual standard lie."Obama urged Floridians to take advantage of the opportunity to vote early, beginning on Monday."', u'"There\'s only one way we lose this election.

[u'There are approximately 250 images, characters and illustrations in the Anti-Defamation League s database of hate symbols.L', u'Last month, a droopy-eyed cartoon frog named Pepe became one of them. ', u'Over the past year, Pepe the Frog has become a regular fixture of racist and anti-Semitic Internet memes   many of them supporting Republican Donald Trump s campaign.B', u'But he wasn t always the mascot of the alt-right. ', u'It s completely insane that Pepe has been labeled a symbol of hate, and that racists and anti-Semites are using a once peaceful frog-dude from my comic book as an icon of hate,  artist Matt Furie, who first introduced his droopy-eyed amphibian to the world 10 years ago with the debut of his comic book  Boys  Club,  wrote last week in an open letter at Time Ideas. ', u'It s a nightmare,  Furie continued, lamenting Pepe s inexplicable evolution from  blissfully stoned frog  to racist calling card    and the only thing I can do is see this as an opportunity to speak out against hate. ', u'The ADL agreed. ', u'The nonprofit is now teaming up with Furie to  #SavePepe  from the hatemongers who ve co-opted him.I', u'In addition to a somewhat terrifying comic depicting Pepe s transformation into a hate symbol, Furie released this week a new drawing of his beloved frog alongside a speech bubble that reads,  Be nice, man. ', u'It s those kinds of positive images of Pepe that the ADL plans to encourage others to share. ', u'The more we can try to encourage people to create positive versions of [Pepe],  the more the ADL hopes those positive images will balance out the negative ones, Oren Segal, director of the ADL s Center on Extremism, told Yahoo News. ', u'Will it override the hate speech? ', u'We ll see, the jury is out,  he said, adding  I think it s worth exploring. ', u'Segal admitted that such an effort to reframe a hate symbol  is very much uncharted territory for us. ', u'But while returning Pepe to his peaceful origins might seem like an uphill battle, he said,  We have to try. ', u'We re going to try. ', u'The ADL s fundamental role is to try to imagine a world without hate, to combat hatred and bigotry wherever it is,  he said.T', u'Though the rehabilitation of Pepe s image is still in its early stages, Segal said he s encouraged by the grassroots movement to reclaim another recent addition to the ADL s database: the triple parenthesis   {{{ }}}    known as the  echo. ', u'Used to identify Jews, or those perceived as Jewish, online, the echo first emerged as a sort of digital Star of David patch in 2014. ', u'But it wasn t until this spring, after white supremacists, anti-Semites and other extremists began aggressively employing the triple parenthesis to harass certain Jewish journalists on social media, that the ADL officially declared the echo a hate symbol.B', u'By the time the echo was entered into the ADL s database, however, many Jewish journalists and others on Twitter had started to reappropriate it, adding the triple parenthesis to their own names in a display of solidarity with those who d been harassed.T', u'This has hardly stopped extremists from using the echo to single out Jews online   as is evidenced by a quick scroll through the Twitter feed of former Ku Klux Klan leader, and current Senate candidate, David Duke. ', u'Eminem is a puppet of (((Paul Rosenberg))) and (((Jimmy Iovine)))   For years Eminem has been poisoning the minds of our youth. #rigged pic.twitter.com/xECYJ0HBsK   David Duke (@DrDavidDuke) October 19, 2016  ', u'But by reclaiming ownership of the echo, Segal suggested, Twitter users may have at least managed to diffuse the negative connotation associated with the symbol so that it carries slightly less weight. ', u'And while Segal acknowledges that the echo is not nearly as widespread as Pepe the Frog, he looks to the efforts to reclaim the triple parenthesis as an example of how to  fight bad speech with good speech. ', u'Segal said he knows there are those who might think  the notion of reclaiming a meme like this is naive. ', u'But, he insists, Pepe is more than just a silly frog meme, and the effort to reclaim him  speaks to the broader work of the ADL, in terms of exposing racism, antisemitism and bigotry of all kinds. ', u'One of the ADL s objectives, he continued  is to talk about how hatred and bigotry spreads. ', u'Today hatred and bigotry doesn t just spread through cross burnings on people s lawns, it spreads online and social media in ways people couldn t have imagined years ago,  he said. ', u'So while,  Yes, it s a frog meme,  said Segal, as long as  it s being used by hate groups to try to harass and intimidate   [it s] not an option to remain silent. ']

[u'Just below the economy, terrorism is the second most important issue for voters in 2016.O', u'Over the course of the 2016 campaign, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have laid out their visions on how to fight terrorism both at home and abroad. ', u'Yahoo s Chief Washington Correspondent Olivier Knox broke down some of their key differences with their approaches toward fighting ISIS, Russia relations and immigration policies ahead of Wednesday s final presidential debate. ', u'Combating ISIS Though Trump and Clinton have vastly different views toward defeating ISIS, the two candidates have some common ground. ', u'Both campaigns have embraced this idea of creating either a no-fly-zone, or a humanitarian zone or a safe area,  said Knox to Yahoo News and Finance Anchor Bianna Golodryga. ', u'They are all slightly different, but the bottom line is you would need American and allied military force to protect, to make that area safe. ', u'Trump has been quick to criticize the Obama administration s efforts toward fighting ISIS, but the GOP presidential candidate has changed his approach throughout the campaign about how to defeat the jihadi militant group. ', u'Back in the primary, [Trump] was talking about sending as many as 40,000 ground troops into the region to take on ISIS; he s walked that back,  said Knox. ', u'He s said at one point that he knew more than the generals   the Pentagon   do about ISIS. ', u'Now his plan    the last time I heard it   his plan was to convene the generals, actually, and get them to come up with a plan about a month into his term. ', u'It s a little hard to evaluate. ', u'Trump s comments have allowed Clinton s hawkishness not to be held to account by voters:  [Clinton] wanted to arm Syrian rebels, she s been consistently more interventionist, she was a big champion of the military semi-intervention in Libya   so there is room to criticize her. ', u'Relations with Russia and Putin Russia s role in this election has been pushed to the forefront in recent weeks after the U.S. intelligence community officially accused the country of hacking the Democratic National Committee and other political organizations. ', u'But Trump and Clinton also have differing opinions of Russian President Vladimir Putin, with Clinton saying Wednesday Putin would rather have Trump,  a puppet,  as president of the United States. [Clinton] wouldn t embrace Putin the way Trump has,  Knox said. ', u'We know that Hillary Clinton was the architect of the so-called  reset  in U.S. ', u'Russian relations. ', u'Trump has consistently advocated for better relations with Russia. ', u'During the final presidential debate, he said:  if Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good. ', u'He has no respect for her. ', u'He has no respect for our president. ', u'Immigration as it relates to terrorism  After the San Bernardino terrorist attack in December, Donald Trump called for  a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on. ', u'Over the summer, Trump expanded his policy by stating,  I will suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies. ', u'Clinton has advocated for taking in more immigrants from war-torn countries like Syria. ', u'Her campaign website states that Clinton wants to  ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories. ', u'The American vetting process is extremely lengthy; you can t just open a spigot and magically bring in a much larger number of refugees,  said Knox. ', u'The Obama administration, they met their target, but their target was pretty low   in one way [Clinton] is promising to do more of a humanitarian thing, but barring some serious changes to the vetting process it seems difficult to actually achieve.

[u'Meanwhile, Clinton s super-PAC, Priorities USA Action, will soon drop hundreds of thousands of dollars on ads attacking embattled Republican senators in New Hampshire (Kelly Ayotte) and Pennsylvania (Pat Toomey), exacerbating a serious GOP spending disadvantage in two critical states.T', u'The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is also spending big. ', u'According to a new report in Politico, the DCCC has been funneling  millions of extra dollars to its House candidates this fall by way of a legal loophole that has helped them bypass the typical limits on coordinated spending between parties and candidates. ', u'Apparently, House hopefuls who mention generic  Democrats  and  Republicans  in their ads   as opposed to just specific candidates   get to split the bill with the party, even if that means they ll blow past the Federal Election Commission s usual coordinated-spending cap of $48,100.A', u'As a result,  more than a dozen Democratic challengers are benefiting from such  hybrid  advertising,  including California s Doug Applegate, Florida s Stephanie Murphy, and New York s Colleen Deacon. ', u'In one particularly extreme case, the DCCC is planning to spend more than 30 times the typical FEC limit to help former Democratic Rep. ', u'Brad Schneider run TV ads against his better-funded opponent, GOP Rep. ', u'Bob Dold of Illinois.A', u'And though the DCCC s latest ad buy is hardly surprising   it consists of a trio of spots slamming recent GOP Trump dumpers for not denouncing the Donald sooner   a simultaneous effort by its sister super-PAC is turning some heads. ', u'According to The Hill,  the House Majority PAC, which works to help Democrats retake the lower chamber, launched a series of ads this week targeting not only toss-up races, but also second-tier seats thought to be safely Republican just a few months ago, including those held by Reps. ', u'David Valadao (Calif.) and Lee Zeldin (N.Y.). ', u'Like Clinton s Arizona push, this suggests that Democrats see some new pathways to victory opening up at the eleventh hour.T', u'Then there s the president to consider. ', u'Just this week, Barack Obama appeared in his first down-ballot TV and radio ads of the cycle   for Senate candidates Catherine Cortez Masto in Nevada and Patrick Murphy in Florida, among others   and sent out a rare fundraising email on behalf of Toomey s challenger, Katie McGinty. ', u'Given that Obama s approval rating is currently hovering above 50 percent, expect more of the same in the campaign s final sprint.B', u'Brad Schneider, a Democratic candidate for Illinois  10th Congressional District, makes a point during a debate. (Photo: Steve Lundy/Daily Herald via AP)The question now is whether any of these offensive maneuvers will make the difference between winning or losing control of Congress.I', u'It s certainly possible. ', u'The Senate is already leaning Democratic. ', u'Assuming Clinton wins the White House, the Dems need a net gain of four seats to take control. ', u'Two weeks ago   before Trump s  Access Hollywood  tape came out and roughly a dozen alleged victims of his inappropriate sexual advances came forward   the party stood a 50-50 chance of pulling it off, according to the New York Times  Upshot forecasting model. ', u'Now the same model gives them a 61 percent chance.T', u'This is largely a result of polling shifts in the state that hosted Wednesday s debate: Nevada. ', u'In the wake of the  Access Hollywood  flap earlier this month, Nevada s Republican Senate candidate, Rep. ', u'Joe Heck, disavowed Trump, whom he had steadfastly supported. ', u'Conservatives booed, accusing Heck of cowardice; Democrats pounced, painting him as an opportunist. ', u'Heck had led in every survey since the start of September   but now the four polls taken since Oct. 8 show Cortez Masto ahead, on average.I', u'It s too soon to say for sure, but Wednesday s  I ll keep you in suspense  moment could create similar problems for other GOP Senate candidates nationwide. ', u'At the very least, it will give Clinton & Co. more grist for all those down-ballot attack ads. ', u'Even before the debate, Democrats were planning to step up  their efforts to yoke down-ballot Republicans to Donald Trump [by] savaging an ever-increasing number of GOP candidates as pawns of their party s embattled presidential nominee. ', u'The House is trickier to game out. ', u'For one thing, Democrats don t need to flip just four seats to win control; they need to flip 30. ', u'That s a Herculean task for several reasons. ', u'According to our expert partners at the Cook Political Report, there are only 37 competitive races   total   including six for seats currently held by Democrats. ', u'Today, even if they won all 6 seats in Lean Democratic and all 18 seats in Toss Up, they would still need to win 11 of 13 races in Lean Republican to win the majority,  writes Cook analyst David Wasserman.P', u'Political science has also shown that the more of a lock one party s presidential nominee becomes, the more voters tend to gravitate toward the other party s down-ballot candidates in the name of  balance. ', u'Redistricting gives Republicans a built-in advantage. ', u'Tying GOP candidates to Trump doesn t seem to be working particularly well in blue-collar districts. ', u'And so far, Democrats aren t leading by a big enough margin on the generic congressional ballot question   the one that asks voters which party they want to preside over Capitol Hill next year   to propel 30 or more of their House pickup candidates to victory.D', u'Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto listens to Rep. ', u'Joe Heck during the Nevada senatorial debate Oct. 14. (Photo: Erik Verduzco/Las Vegas Review-Journal via AP)So why even bother speculating about it? ', u'Because the more Trump falters   and the more he hints that he may not honor the electoral will of the American people   the more he risks depressing GOP turnout on Nov. 8.A', u'And if that happens, all bets are off. ', u'In this volatile environment, the current fundraising gap [with Democrats] is unsustainable, and will negatively affect Republican electoral prospects if not addressed,  the National Republican Congressional Committee said in a memo that leaked on Wednesday. ', u'We could run the risk of facing substantial losses on November 8. ', u'The picture on the Senate side looks the same, with Democrats ready to outspend Republicans in Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Indiana, Nevada and Missouri in the coming weeks, according to an internal GOP document obtained by Politico.D', u'Democrats aren t banking on a wave election. ', u'But they want to be ready if an anti-Trump swell starts to take shape. ', u'On Tuesday, the DCCC revealed that it had raised a record-breaking $21 million in September, nearly double its haul for the previous two months combined. ', u'The logic behind this spending spree is simple. ', u'At worst, Democrats will expand the map, forcing Republicans to play defense. ', u'At best, they ll end up with a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress._____Let the  check and balance  games beginFor months now, down-ballot Republicans have been hinting that, if things get really bad for Donald Trump, they might pull a 1996. ', u'GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole stands before the Republican National Convention with his wife, Elizabeth, in 1996. (Photo: Scott Andrews, POOL/AP) T', u'That year, GOP House and Senate candidates ditched Bob Dole, conceded that President Bill Clinton was going to win re-election, and pitched themselves to voters as a check on Clinton s  liberal agenda. ', u'The strategy wound up working: Republicans retained control of the House and picked up two seats in the Senate that November. ', u'Republicans have yet to deploy the  check and balance  argument in any sort of widespread or coordinated manner. ', u'But that could change after Wednesday s disastrous debate. ', u'The biggest loser tonight was not Trump,  said Robert Blizzard, a GOP pollster who is working on a number of congressional races. ', u'The presidential race is over. ', u'Instead, down-ticket Republicans lost tonight   they needed some help and got absolutely none. ', u'As a result, be on the lookout for more  check and balance  talk from the GOP in the final weeks of the campaign. ', u'Democrats certainly are. ', u'In fact, they already seem to be ready with a response. ', u'So what does  checks and balances  mean? ', u'House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told reporters Wednesday. ', u'It s a euphemism for obstruction.

[u'Bernie Sanders  former campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, joined Yahoo News and Finance Anchor Bianna Golodryga on  2016: The Choice  to talk about the final presidential debate and give his take on what s been revealed in some of the hacked emails, leaked by WikiLeaks, from John Podesta, Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman.O', u'On Donald Trump refusing to say whether he ll accept the results of the election, Weaver said,  It s a central tenet of our democracy that we have a peaceful transfer of power, that we have an election. ', u'They re hard-fought. ', u'Believe me, I was just involved in a very hard-fought contest between Bernie Sanders and Secretary Clinton. ', u'He continued,  If Donald Trump loses now and the Republicans lose this time, they ll have their opportunity at the presidency in four years. ', u'That s just the way our democratic process works and to repudiate that is a really dangerous precedent. ', u'On Trump being seemingly out of step with others in his campaign, including his running mate, Gov. Mike Pence, on accepting the election results, Weaver said,  This type of disconnect between the candidate and basically everyone around the candidate is a very, very unusual circumstance. ', u'As you know, the Trump campaign has gone through quite a few transitions in leadership in terms of staff. ', u'It s just really, from a campaign organizational standpoint, it really seems like a horror show over there. ', u'On Trump using Sanders  comments about Clinton s  bad judgment  as his own talking point against Clinton in the debate and throughout the general election, Weaver said,  Well, Donald Trump can make whatever he wants a talking point. ', u'The truth of the matter is that we are in the general election, and one of two candidates is going to be president after this election. ', u'It s either going to be Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump, and given that comparison, there s no doubt that Secretary Clinton is heads and shoulders above Donald Trump in terms of being an intelligent, capable leader who can move the country forward. ', u'On what the contents of the leaked WikiLeaks emails from the Clinton campaign reveal about the Democratic presidential candidate s relationship with Wall Street and her position on trade, Weaver said,  Well, certainly I think they speak for themselves. ', u'Certainly in a purely political sense, we wish, obviously, we had the emails earlier in the process, but again, you know, we re not going to relitigate it. ', u'Weaver did acknowledge, however, the dangers of the Russian government being involved in hacking these emails. ', u'He said,  This is a very dangerous situation where you have a foreign intelligence service which is hacking into the emails of not only political campaigns, but into political parties in this country. ', u'He continued,  I hope that the U.S. takes strong action to make sure that not just campaigns and party committees, but also individuals are protected from hacking by foreign intelligence services. ', u'On whether he would have used the emails during the primaries knowing they were from the Russians, Weaver said,  You re talking about a hypothetical, obviously, and this information, had it been available in the primary, I m not exactly sure how we quote-unquote would ve used it. ', u'I think that those who suggest that it would ve been more relevant to the primary are probably correct as a matter of academics, but that s really, you know, for the history books at this point and for speculation. ', u'Finally, on whether he thinks Clinton can accomplish some of the policies that she has adopted from Sanders if she wins the presidency, Weaver said,  It s going to be a difficult environment obviously. ', u'Hopefully the Democrats will take back the Senate. ', u'It s not clear that the Democrats are going to be able to take the House, but hopefully they ll be able to narrow the margin in the House.

[u'One of the reforms designed to rein in the surveillance authorities of the National Security Agency has perhaps inadvertently solved a technical problem for the spy outfit and granted it potential access to much more data than before, a former top official told ABC News.B', u"Before the signing of the USA Freedom Act in June 2015, one of the NSA's most controversial programs was the mass collection of telephonic metadata from millions of Americans   the information about calls, including the telephone numbers involved, the time and the duration but not the calls' content   under a broad interpretation of the Patriot Act's Section 215. ", u'From this large "haystack," as officials have called it, NSA analysts could get approval to run queries on specific numbers purportedly linked to international terrorism investigations.T', u"The problem for the NSA was that the haystack was only about 30 percent as big as it should've been; the NSA database was missing a lot of data. ", u'The metadata also came in various forms from the different companies, so the NSA had to reformat much of it before loading it into a searchable database.B', u"Both hurdles meant that the NSA couldn't keep up, and of all the metadata the agency wanted to be available for specific searches internally, only about a third of it actually was.B", u'But then the USA Freedom Act was signed into law, and now Inglis said, all that is "somebody else\'s problem."The USA Freedom Act ended the NSA\'s bulk collection of metadata but charged the telecommunications companies with keeping the data on hand. ', u'The NSA and other U.S. government agencies now must request information about specific phone numbers or other identifying elements from the telecommunications companies after going through the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) court and arguing that there is a "reasonable, articulable suspicion" that the number is associated with international terrorism.A', u'As a result, the NSA no longer has to worry about keeping up its own database and, according to Inglis, the percentage of available records has shot up from 30 percent to virtually 100. ', u'Rather than one internal, incomplete database, the NSA can now query any of several complete ones.T', u'The new system "guarantees that the NSA can have access to all of it," Inglis said.N', u'NSA general counsel Glenn Gerstell made a brief reference to the increased capacity in a post for the Lawfare blog in January after terrorist attacks at home and abroad."', u'"Largely overlooked in the debate that has ensued in the wake of recent attacks is the fact that under the new arrangement, our national security professionals will have access to a greater volume of call records subject to query in a way that is consistent with our regard for civil liberties," he wrote.M', u'Mark Rumold, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told ABC News he doesn\'t have much of a problem with the NSA\'s wider access to telephone data, since now the agency has to go through a "legitimate" system with "procedural protections" before jumping into the databases."', u'"Their ability to obtain records has broadened, but by all accounts, they\'re collecting a far narrower pool of data than they were initially," he said, referring to returns on specific searches. ', u'Whereas in the past the NSA could instantaneously run approved searches of its database, now the agency must approach each telecommunications company to ask about a number and then wait for a response.I', u'In his January post Gerstell acknowledged concerns that the new approach could be "too cumbersome to be effective" and said the NSA will report to Congress on how the arrangement is working. ', u'A representative for the NSA declined to tell ABC News if any problems have been encountered so far, and Rumold noted there has been no public evidence of any issues.I', u"Inglis said he isn't terribly concerned if the searches are a little slower.

', u'Trump, trailing in the polls, sparked a wave of criticism at the debate Wednesday night when he refused to commit to accepting the election results if Democrat Hillary Clinton emerges victorious Nov. 8. ', u'Clinton called his response  horrifying  and a number of Republicans spoke out against Trump s position, which undermines a basic tenet of the democratic transition of power.L', u'Last week, Trump started peppering his stump speech with the conspiratorial claim that the U.S. election would be rigged against him.

', u'But in textual form, the cues are gone, and we lose the thread. ', u'The proper way to transcribe Trump, Liberman later wrote, was . of UC Berkeley, Trump uses people s  not just with tactics like repetition, framing, and skilled deploying of sentence fragments which people automatically finish in their heads. ', u'They commonly feel empathy and intimacy, an acceptance of what is being said, and good feeling toward the speaker,   this summer.

[u'That s a wrap, folks. ', u'Thanks for coming. ', u'You ve been a terrific audience.F', u'For 16 months, Donald Trump s accidental campaign was the hottest thing on TV. ', u'Even Trump seemed surprised when his little side project, sandwiched between seasons of  The Apprentice  and premised on giving away a bunch of hats, blew up into a cultural phenomenon.H', u'How could he have known it would be that easy to take over an entire party? ', u'I sure didn t. Turns out the Republican Party was like  Wheel of Fortune ; people followed out of habit, but they were sick to death of the reruns.B', u'But as Trump scowled and scoffed his way through one final debate, it was clear that his egomaniacal show had finally played itself out. ', u'After weeks of ugly disclosures and cratering polls, all that remained for Trump was to figure out some way to end the series without having to admit it was canceled.S', u'So after railing all week against a  rigged  election, Trump pointedly refused   twice   to say he would accept the result as legitimate. ', u'I ll keep you in suspense,  he said instead. ', u'I guess every dying show needs its cliffhanger finale.A', u'As the candidate himself might have put it in one of his famous tweets: Trump claiming fraud because his poll numbers are horrible! ', u'I ll make a rare prediction here, which is that someday in the not-so-distant future, when he feels like not enough people are paying attention to him, Trump will generate headlines by telling a reporter he never really wanted to be president, anyway. ', u'And it will be the truest thing he s said in a while.B', u'But what about the rest of us? ', u'What kind of shaken country will Trump leave in his tumultuous wake? ', u'How do we fix what s broken?T', u'This much we know: The next inauguration won t feel at all like the one I sat through, in a bitter freeze, eight years earlier, at a moment when it was possible to believe that America had turned a cultural and generational corner.I', u'I ve always thought President Obama should have returned the Nobel Peace Prize he was awarded in 2009. ', u'I say this not because he hadn t earned it (obviously he hadn t), but because Obama s Nobel seemed to me an unmistakable statement on the way elite Europeans viewed America.T', u'The supposition underlying the award seemed to be that our country was so self-evidently racist and violent that the mere act of a black man winning the presidency constituted an unfathomable act of courage and resistance.H', u'Had I been advising Obama then, I d have suggested he go out to the Rose Garden and tell the world that his campaign had affirmed exactly the opposite   that America was a more enlightened country than it used to be, that it took no Gandhi-like resolve to run as a nonwhite candidate anymore, and that the bigotry of an earlier era was fast receding to the margins of the society.Y', u'You might say I was naive, seeing as a sizable chunk of the country is about to vote for a man heartily endorsed by David Duke. ', u'But I still believe I was right.A', u'A lot of Americans will vote for Trump in November in spite of his bigotry and xenophobia, not because of it. ', u'They can t stomach Hillary Clinton, or they re desperate to upend Washington, or they re just diehard Republicans, and they hope   foolishly, I think   that Trump would somehow blossom into a president who s bigger than the insecure and reckless man they watched again last night.B', u'But that s distinct from the much smaller universe of furious, nostalgic, culturally displaced voters who drag their kids to Trump rallies, who see themselves living in a racially defined society where white men are the oppressed class, who have no real problem with violence or misogyny or people holding signs with swastikas.T', u'There aren t actually more of these voters than there used to be. ', u'Contrary to liberal hysteria, Trump hasn t managed to ignite some new White Power movement.W', u'What he s done, in his frenzied, yearlong effort to find love and acceptance among people with whom he really has nothing in common, is to relegitimize attitudes that had become unacceptable in polite conversation and often career-ending in public discourse.T', u'This is a different thing from enforcing political correctness, which is what bigots always scream you re trying to do. ', u'I ve written a few times before about my disdain for  safe spaces  and  trigger warnings  and the bleaching out of historical figures who make us uncomfortable. ', u'I ll be the first one to stand up for your right to disagree about how we define liberty and progress.N', u'No, what we re talking about here is a worldview that says: America is a white, male-dominated, Christian country, and the blurring of cultures and ethnicities (not to mention genders) represents not our evolution, but rather our undoing. ', u'It is an inherently anti-American creed, and until this year it had been gradually discredited in national politics. ', u'The effect of Trump s televised rallies and rhetoric, void of compassion or intellect, can be seen now in places you wouldn t have normally encountered it before. ', u'Take, for instance, the recent experience of Michael Luo, my former colleague at the New York Times, who wrote about a woman on Manhattan s Upper East Side who shouted at him to take his family back to China where they belonged. ', u'In Trump s America, as in the Reality TV world from which he spawned, nothing is too outrageous or too mean to blurt out. ', u'No one needs to accept modernity or feel shame for spewing ignorance. ', u'This is his legacy. ', u'It s also about to become the legacy of the Republican Party, which is why Republican leaders will have a special responsibility to deal with it once this runaway train has to come to rest against the side of a mountain. ', u'For years now, ruling Republicans have tried to have it both ways   to somehow mollify and exploit the darkest impulses of the electorate while publicly espousing the high-minded principles of conservatism. ', u'After both of the last presidential elections, Republicans had a muted argument   more of a discussion, really   about how to expand their reach. ', u'That awkward conversation went pretty much nowhere, because Republican leaders didn t want to offend any core constituencies. ', u'But now they owe it to the country to clean up after themselves. ', u'It s time to firmly renounce and marginalize the last vestiges of a 1950s social order   if not from a moral imperative, then surely from a political one. ', u'This will be, after all, the fourth straight election in which Republicans have been crushed among first-time voters. ', u'And at the end of the day, Trump will probably pull fewer than a third of so-called millennial voters, who are already surpassing baby boomers as the largest share of the electorate. ', u'You can bet Republicans will spend the next few months talking about what a terrible messenger Trump was. ', u'After that, they ll pivot to reminding people of how little they like Clinton, and they ll start searching for a candidate who can offer a better contrast in 2020. ', u'But there is no distancing the party from Trump without disowning what he represents. ', u'Further down the well-worn path of accommodation and avoidance, there is only losing and irrelevance. ', u'The Trump Show is just about over. ', u'Governing Republicans can t afford a sequel, and neither can the rest of us.']

[u'If the third presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump took place in 1996, you d scarcely notice the economy they were talking about was 20 years in the future.T', u'There was no discussion of the digital economy when Trump and Clinton met in Las Vegas to spar for one final time before voters hit the polls on Nov. 8. ', u'Nothing about automation or workers becoming obsolete. ', u'The only reference to the internet involved Clinton s ever-elusive emails. ', u'Clinton made one vague reference to  high-tech manufacturing,  a comment that could have come any time during the last 30 years. ', u'Other than that, you d think the US economy was still dominated by smokestacks and jackhammers.C', u'Clinton wants to tax the wealthy and use the proceeds to fund thousands of new jobs building roads and bridges, as Democratic politicians have sought to do for decades. ', u'Republican Donald Trump wants to tear up trade deals that have made the US economy more efficient than ever and forced down the prices of many everyday products.S', u'Some inconvenient facts undermine these backward-looking prescriptions for sluggish economic growth. ', u'First, there is no shortage of jobs in America today. ', u'Employers report 5.4 million openings at the moment, nearly the highest number in the 14 years the government has been tracking such data:At the same time, the number of working-age adults who either have a job or are looking for one is at the lowest level since 1978. ', u'That tells us there are a lot of jobs that people either don t want or aren t qualified for. ', u'People aren t looking for work, even though it s there.M', u'Manufacturing isn t nearly the problem Trump claims it is. ', u'Real manufacturing output, adjusted for inflation, is just about back to the peak reached in 2008, before the latest recession. ', u'And it s 85% higher than in 1988, the last year of Ronald Reagan s presidency, which some consider a time of peak prosperity. ', u'Manufacturing employment, however, has been plunging since 1998. ', u'So the work is there, but the workers aren t. Here s the data:Manufacturing is not a sector of the economy that s been decimated by outsourcing, as Trump repeatedly insists. ', u'It s more like a sector that has been transformed by automation, with software and machines replacing human workers, and the jobs that remain increasingly requiring skilled workers able to operate complex machinery and even program it. ', u'We have skills and jobs that we could be developing right here without bringing other jobs back,  says Cornell University professor John Hausknecht. ', u'We could be investing to help ease some of the labor shortages we already have. ', u'Trump and Clinton don t see it that way. ', u'Their plans are very different, but each would involve huge costs that are arguably unnecessary, and almost certainly more than we can afford. ', u'The centerpiece of Trump s plan is a whole new set of trade deals and regulations meant to discourage cheap imports to the United States, in theory encouraging more US manufacturing. ', u'That would boost prices on many everyday goods and force may big companies to revamp their supply chains and the way they move goods around the world. ', u'If Trump s plan ever helped create jobs, it would probably come only after an economic slowdown and perhaps a recession caused by the massive displacement of corporate resources.T', u'The cost of Clinton s infrastructure plan is in dollars up to $300 billion, which she d raise by hiking taxes on the wealthy and on financial institutions. ', u'Stimulus programs are most effective when unemployment is high and there are a lot of available workers. ', u'That s not the situation now. ', u'The unemployment rate is a low 5%, with shortages of construction workers in cities such as San Francisco and Portland. ', u'If stimulus spending draws workers out of other fields where they re already employed, it can depress growth and cause other distortions.W', u'What would be better? ', u'There are a lot of ideas for channeling workers into the jobs that exist, rather than tearing up the economy we have and trying to repurpose the jobs of the past. ', u'The next president can create a tremendous number of digital-economy jobs and enable people to have skills to thrive in them,  says Zo  Baird, CEO of the nonprofit Markle Foundation. ', u'We need rapid low-cost training that gets people the education they need, and helps them update skills throughout their careers. ', u'The gap between available jobs and available workers largely involves so-called middle skills, the kind that require some specialized training but not a college degree. ', u'Assembly-line jobs used to fit the profile, but manufacturers don t rely on workers turning wrenches the way they used to. ', u'They do, however, need workers who can operate and service robots and other sophisticated machines, use 3-D printers, or apply information-technology skills in traditionally non-digital fields such as retail and health care.A', u'A big problem many workers face is knowing what employers are looking for in the first place, since technology changes quickly. ', u'Surveys suggest many displaced workers would get retrained, except they don t know what to get retrained for. ', u'The jobs of the future aren t always in the same place as the disappearing jobs of the past, and some people are reluctant to move, if they even know where they ought to move to. ', u'Companies themselves often do a bad job of explaining what kinds of middle-skill workers they re looking for, posting requirements by degree or certification instead of identifying an actual skill they need. ', u'And many companies have cut back sharply on the training they pay for themselves, expecting job applicants to show up pre-trained.A', u'An economic plan focused on the jobs of the future might target new ways to help job seekers find positions that are already open, whether through new training, relocation assistance, or just reliable information on today s hottest skills. ', u'The key to that isn t a series of trade wars or an improbable tax hike needed to raise revenue it s up-to-date information that would let more people make pragmatic decisions.T', u'The stock markets process billions of pieces of data every second in order to provide accurate real-time pricing of securities based on supply, demand and other factors. ', u'Data on jobs is not collected the way stock market data is,  says Baird.C', u'Could it be? ', u'Could the government do it? ', u'The candidates ought to give it a try. ', u'Neither has.T', u'Trump was born in 1946, Clinton in 1947. ', u'There s nothing inherently wrong with a candidate s age, provided he or she remains plugged into the cultural zeitgeist and capable of learning what people two generations younger know. ', u'Neither Clinton nor Trump, however, seems interested in learning about the digital economy that will dominate the lives of their grandkids. ', u'Instead, their outdated message seems to be: grab a hardhat.R', u'Rick Newman is the author of four books, including  . ', u'Follow him on Twitter: @rickjnewman.']

[u"HONOLULU (AP)   A $1.4 billion project to build one of the world's largest telescopes is up against intense protests by Native Hawaiians and others who say building it on the Big Island's Mauna Kea mountain will desecrate sacred land.H", u"Hearings for the project's construction permit are set to begin Thursday and expected to last until next month.

', u'The 13 telescopes already on Mauna Kea have played major roles in discoveries considered among the most significant to astronomy. ', u'Partners would receive a share of observing time, along with University of Hawaii scientists.___THE LOCATIONTelescope officials say Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano, is the best location in the world for astronomy. ', u"It's Hawaii's tallest volcano and its summit provides a clear view of the sky for 300 days a year, with little air and light pollution.

', u'All of the highest points in the islands are considered the home of deities, said Kealoha Pisciotta, one of the leaders in the telescope fight.___POWER OF PROTESTERSProtests disrupted a groundbreaking and Hawaiian blessing ceremony at the site two years ago.

", u'In 2011, opponents requested so-called contested-case hearings before the state land board approved a permit to build on conservation land. ', u'The hearings were held, and the permit was upheld. ', u'Opponents then sued. ', u"In December 2015, the state Supreme Court revoked the permit, ruling the land board's approval process was flawed. ", u"That meant the application process needed to be redone, requiring a new hearing.___WHAT'S AT STAKE I", u"If the project dies, not only will that be bad for Hawaii astronomy, but for any high-tech industry considering Hawaii, said Paul Coleman, a Native Hawaiian astrophysicist at the University of Hawaii's Institute for Astronomy. ", u'The partners invested $170 million through the end of 2015, Thirty Meter Telescope Executive Director Ed Stone said.

[u'The number of Americans who want legal weed keeps rising.A', u'A Gallup poll released Wednesday showed that support for making marijuana legal in the United States has reached 60 percent   higher than it has ever been since Gallup first started asking this question in 1969, when only 12 percent of Americans supported legalization.A', u'According to Gallup, support rose to 28 percent in the 1970s, slipped during the  Just Say No  campaign of the 1980s, stayed around 25 percent in the 1990s and rose to 31 percent at the turn of the century. ', u'A majority of Americans supported legalization for the first time in 2013, after Washington and Colorado legalized the drug for recreational use.D', u'During the past decade, support for legalization has increased in most subgroups, but it is still much higher among people between ages 18 and 34 (77 percent), Democrats (67 percent) and independents (70 percent) than people 55 or older (45 percent) and Republicans (42 percent).T', u'The plant is already legal, to a varying extent, in four states   Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington   and the District of Columbia.F', u'Frank Newport, editor in chief of Gallup.com, told Yahoo News that it s noteworthy that current support for legalization among young people is higher than it has been in the past.

', u'He said his researchers don t always know what drives fluctuating public opinion   whether it s support for marriage equality or President Obama s approval rating   but his team often discusses possible reasons. ', u'We often hypothesize that when Americans are aware of the fact that in Colorado and these other states you can actually smoke pot, it s easier for them, when we call them up and ask this longstanding trend question,  Should it be made legal or not?  people say,  Well, I guess so, more and more states are doing it. ', u'But, Newport added, this could be a chicken-or-egg dilemma: Are attitudes changing because laws are changing? ', u'Or are laws changing because attitudes are changing?T', u'The poll comes as voters in five states   Massachusetts, Nevada, Arizona, California and Maine   have initiatives on the ballot concerning the regulation and taxation of pot for recreational use by adults.A', u'As Gallup pointed out, if these ballot measures pass, the portion of Americans living in states with legal marijuana could shoot up from 5 percent to as much as 25 percent.M', u'Mason Tvert, the director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project, a pot policy reform group, said a majority of the U.S. understands that marijuana is far less harmful than alcohol and wants the two substances handled similarly. ', u'At the federal level, marijuana remains a schedule I drug, the strictest level of classification reserved for substances with no accepted medical use. ', u'There s a clear trend in the level of support for ending marijuana prohibition,  Tvert told Yahoo News. ', u'We re seeing support grow among every single age group, whether people are a freshman in college or a senior citizen, more and more of them agree, marijuana should be legal. ', u'It s really just a result of people learning more about this substance and the failures of our current prohibition laws. ', u'Individual states, he continued, have taken it upon themselves to move forward as the federal government continues to tread water. ', u'In the past, he said, amendments proposing limited marijuana reform could reach Congress. ', u'But they would fail by a large margin. ', u'Now there s very solid support for those types of measures but they re not even coming up for votes because of the gridlock and the partisanship,  Tvert said.L', u'Last week, the Pew Research Center released a similar national poll that found 57 percent of Americans said they think cannabis should be legal   up from 53 percent last year.

[u'Riyadh (AFP) - A seven-fold hike in visa fees to do business in Saudi Arabia risks deterring the foreign investment needed to transform its oil-dependent economy, diplomats and other sources say.B', u'But a senior Saudi business leader has dismissed such concerns, insisting the country\'s most sought-after business partners could easily afford the new charges."', u'"It\'s incredibly short-sighted," a Riyadh-based diplomat said of the changes which took effect this month."', u'"They\'re obviously bleeding and they want to put the cost on foreigners as much as they can," he said, asking for anonymity.

[u"PHOENIX (AP)   A judge presiding over a lawsuit that protests how Arizona carries out the death penalty extracted promises in court from the state Wednesday that it won't use the sedative midazolam in future executions.L", u"Lawyers for the state are seeking to dismiss the lawsuit's claim that midazolam can't ensure that condemned inmates won't feel the pain caused by another drug in a three-drug execution protocol. ", u"The state said it won't use the sedative in the future even if it finds a new supply.U", u'District Judge Neil Wake said the state\'s decision to voluntarily end its midazolam use in executions could be changed in the future by a state prisons director or a governor."', u'"There is nothing to stop the director or a future director or a future governor from saying the world has changed," Wake said, marking the second time in recent months that he has questioned the solidity of the state\'s claim on finding midazolam.A', u"Arizona announced nearly four months ago that it was eliminating its use of midazolam after its supply expired and another supplier couldn't be found because of pressure from opponents of the death penalty. ", u"Attorneys for the state say the lawsuit's midazolam claim is moot because the drug won't be used in the future executions.W", u'Wake scheduled the hearing after learning that Ohio now has a supply of midazolam and plans to resume executions there in January.C', u"Collin Wedel, an attorney representing the condemned inmates who filed the lawsuit, said the state's claim that it can't find the sedative doesn't hold water because Ohio, Mississippi, Alabama and Arkansas have already said they have a midazolam supply.J", u"Jeffrey Sparks, an attorney representing the state, said the state wasn't arguing that there is no midazolam available anywhere, but rather that Arizona's prison system simply can't acquire it.W", u"Wake hasn't yet decided whether to dismiss the lawsuit's midazolam claim.E", u'Executions in Arizona will remain on hold until the lawsuit is resolved. ', u'They were put on hold after the July 2014 death of convicted killer Joseph Rudolph Wood, who was given 15 dozes of midazolam and a painkiller and who took nearly two hours to die. ', u'His attorney said the execution was botched.S', u"Several of the lawsuit's claims have been dismissed, but lawyers for the condemned inmates want to press forward with allegations that the state has abused its discretion in the methods and amounts of the drugs used in past executions.S", u'Similar challenges to the death penalty are playing out in other parts of the country that seek more transparency about where states get their execution drugs.S', u'States are struggling to obtain execution drugs because European pharmaceutical companies began blocking the use of their products for lethal injections.___Follow Jacques Billeaud at twitter.com/jacquesbilleaud.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   A senior State Department official asked the FBI last year to help reduce the classification of an email from Hillary Clinton's private server, according to FBI investigative files made public Monday. ", u'It was to be part of a bargain that would have allowed the FBI to deploy more agents in foreign countries, according to the files.I', u"It was not immediately clear whether the State Department official or someone at the FBI first raised the prospect of a bargain over the email's classification.T", u'The bureau records, citing an FBI official whose name was censored, said Undersecretary for Management Patrick F. Kennedy sought assistance in exchange for a "quid pro quo."But the FBI said Monday it was the now-retired FBI official who first asked Kennedy about deploying more agents overseas. ', u'The State Department said the same."', u'"This allegation is inaccurate and does not align with the facts," State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Monday. ', u"He said Kennedy had been trying to understand the FBI's classification decisions, and added that there was never an increase in the number of FBI agents assigned to Iraq as a result of the conversations.T", u'The FBI ultimately rejected the idea, which would have allowed the State Department to archive a message related to the 2012 attacks on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, in the basement of its Washington headquarters "never to be seen again," according to the FBI files.T', u'The email described reports in November 2012 that Libyan police were arresting suspects in the attack. ', u"It had been forwarded to Clinton's private email address by Jake Sullivan, one of her top aides and the department's director of policy planning, who was using his government email account.R", u'Republicans seized on the report as collusion within the Obama administration to protect Clinton, now the Democratic presidential nominee."', u'"CORRUPTION CONFIRMED: FBI confirms State Dept. offered \'quid pro quo\' to cover up classified emails," read a tweet from Team Trump, retweeted by the candidate.C', u'Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said the campaign had never been part of any such discussion about email classifications.K', u"Kennedy was a close aide to Clinton during her tenure as the nation's top diplomat between 2009 and early 2013.

', u'Toner suggested that Kennedy may not have raised the "B9" exemption at all, but rather "B7"   a separate exemption protecting confidential communications with law enforcement. ', u'Toner said that exemption could have still allowed parts of the document to be released. ', u'Toner also denied there was any proposed deal, saying the FBI official first raised the number of bureau personnel approved to be in Iraq at the end of the phone call as a separate issue. ', u'As for the FBI official\'s account, he said, "I can\'t speak to what this person\'s intent, whether they misunderstood the atmosphere of that conversation, I have no idea. All I can say is that there was no quid pro quo." T', u'The Associated Press reported the existence of the secret Benghazi-related email in May 2015, though the classified content of the document has never been made public. ', u'At the time, administration officials acknowledged interagency disagreements about whether certain information in the emails was classified.

[u'Washington (AFP) - The number of unaccompanied children illegally entering the United States across its southern border spiked 49 percent over the past year, officials in Washington said on Monday.T', u'The Department of Homeland Security reported that 56,692 children traveling without adults were intercepted at the US border with Mexico in the fiscal year ending in September, compared with 39,970 the previous year.O', u'Overall, 408,870 adults and children were intercepted at the border, an increase of 23 percent over the previous year, according to the DHS.H', u'Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said the number of undocumented immigrants, while on the rise, is a fraction of the number entering the United States from the 1980s through 2008."', u'"The demographics of illegal migration on our southern border has changed significantly over the last 15 years," Johnson said in a statement."', u'"Far fewer Mexicans and single adults are attempting to cross the border without authorization, but more families and unaccompanied children are fleeing poverty and violence in Central America."For the second time in three years, more Central Americans were caught at the border than Mexicans, the agency reported.

Walls alone cannot prevent illegal migration," Johnson said."', u'"Ultimately, the solution is long-term investment in Central America to address the underlying push factors in the region."Johnson said the DHS has tried to enforce the immigration laws "in a fair and humane way.""But, the reality is the system is broken, and badly in need of comprehensive immigration reform that only Congress can provide," he said.J', u'Johnson also called for the creation of a path for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States to "get right with the law."The DHS report comes three weeks ahead of the November 8 presidential election, with the immigration issue looming large -- particularly in the campaign of Republican candidate Donald Trump, who has vowed to build a wall along the southwestern border and make Mexico pay for it.D', u'Democrat Hillary Clinton, by contrast, has called for immigration reforms that could provide a pathway to legal status for many undocumented immigrants.']

[u"Paris (AFP) - Europe's second attempt to reach Mars' surface appeared in peril Thursday as initial analysis suggested the latest lander may have plummeted to its demise.W", u"While holding out faint hope, ground controllers said it seemed the paddling pool-sized lander's parachute may have been discarded too early, and its fall-breaking thrusters switched off too soon.T", u'The lander, dubbed Schiaparelli, was on a test-run for a future rover that will seek out evidence of life, past or present, on the Red Planet.B', u'But it fell silent seconds before its scheduled touchdown, while its mothership Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO) entered Mars\' orbit as planned -- part of a joint European-Russian project."', u'"We are not in a position yet to determine the dynamic condition at which the lander touched the ground," European Space Agency (ESA) head of solar and planetary missions Andrea Accomazzo told a webcast news briefing at mission control in Darmstadt, Germany.F', u'Further analysis must be done of some 600 megabytes of data the 230 million-euro ($251-million) craft sent home before its signal died, to "know whether it survived structurally or not."This could take "some time", Accomazzo added.E', u'ESA and NASA Mars orbiters, meanwhile, were keeping their eyes and ears open for any signal from the lander.I', u"If not, this would be Europe's second failed Mars landing in a row, joining a string of unsuccessful attempts by global powers to explore our planetary neighbour's hostile surface.T", u'The British-built Beagle 2 robot lab disappeared without trace after separating from its mothership, Mars Express, in 2003.

', u'As for the thrusters, "it seems likely that they switched off sooner than expected," added an ESA press statement. ', u'Since the 1960s, more than half of US, Russian and European attempts to operate craft on the Martian surface have failed.

E', u'Even a crash by Schiaparelli would yield important lessons for the rover, he added, and need not derail the rest of the mission for which ESA will seek additional funding from European governments in December.

[u'By Roberta RamptonMIAMI (Reuters) - President Barack Obama said on Thursday that his departure from office in January might be what it takes to begin to heal the political scars over Obamacare and allow for needed fixes to his signature healthcare law.T', u'The 2010 Affordable Care Act tipped off a long and bitter political and legal battle between the White House and Republicans in the U.S. ', u'Congress who said the 2010 law creates unwarranted government intervention in personal healthcare and private industry.R', u'Republicans have been quick to highlight a recent barrage of negative headlines about rising health insurance premiums and shrinking doctor networks for people participating in subsidized insurance plans offered under the law.O', u'Obama acknowledged the law is not working perfectly, but said the problems could be fixed by legislation, encouraging lawmakers to create a government-run health insurance option to help U.S. states where there is little or no competition among private insurers."', u'"Maybe now that I\'m leaving office, maybe Republicans can stop with the 60-something repeal votes they\'ve taken and stop pretending that they have a serious alternative ... and just work with the next president to smooth out the kinks," he said in a speech at Miami Dade College."', u'"They can even change the name of the law to Reagancare, or Paul Ryan care," Obama said, evoking the name of the Republican speaker of the House of Representatives. ', u'"I don\'t care. I just want it to work."But Ryan, in a written response, said he would continue to seek to repeal and replace the law.

', u'Clinton has said she would add a public option and expand tax incentives for healthcare costs. ', u'Republican nominee Donald Trump has pledged to repeal and replace the law.T', u'The government forecasts 13.8 million people will sign up for Obamacare plans in 2017, up 1.1 million from 2016.T', u'There are 10.7 million uninsured people who are eligible for the exchanges but have not enrolled, and about 40 percent of those are young, Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell said on Wednesday.O', u'Obama said that nationwide, not enough young and healthy people have signed up to provide a revenue stream that offsets the costs of covering members with serious illnesses.A', u'As a result, several big insurers, including UnitedHealth Group Inc , Aetna Inc and Humana Inc , are pulling out of the online marketplaces selling the subsidized plans, citing bigger-than-expected financial losses.M', u'Monthly premium prices have climbed, which further discourages some people from signing up."', u'"Next year will tell whether those are growing pains, or they are more serious issues," Drew Altman, chief executive of the Kaiser Family Foundation, said in an interview.A', u'Analysis conducted by the nonpartisan foundation suggests at least 16 million people need to enroll before the online Obamacare insurance marketplaces stabilize.O', u'Obama said expanding insurance coverage for millions of people and reforming the healthcare system was a key reason he ran for office.

", u'The law also prohibited insurance companies from denying coverage to Americans for existing medical problems, and allowed parents to keep children insured on their health plans until age 26. ', u'Some health policy experts on both the political left and right say Congress may be more receptive to bipartisan efforts to fix the Affordable Care Act after Obama leaves office.

[u'NintendoThe Nintendo Switch, formerly the Nintendo NX, debuted today, and it s a strong win for Nintendo in a number of ways. ', u'Nintendo has taken everything people love about the company, namely its portable consoles and casual multiplayer games, and condensed it down into one console. ', u'It looks great, and if it can deliver on the promises of its first trailer, Nintendo is likely to have an enormous winner on its hands. ', u'But it s also fascinating because Nintendo, with the Switch, is turning away from Microsoft and Sony, and towards Apple, Google, and the rest of the tablet and smartphone market. ', u'And anybody in that market should brace for impact.A', u'A year ago, we talked about how Nintendo was heading in this direction, and it s difficult to see even titans like Apple fighting with Nintendo. ', u'Nintendo is one of the most trusted, and beloved, brands in the world, with more than thirty years of manufacturing experience. ', u'They have a roster of beloved characters. ', u'They have a marketing and distribution reach that dwarfs almost any company in the market. ', u'And, probably the toughest aspect, Nintendo appears to be delivering a ridiculously powerful console for what will likely be a dirt cheap price for what you get, namely a dock to connect to your TV and an input device.M', u'More fundamentally, the tablet market is mature enough to play directly to one of Nintendo s core philosophies: Lateral Thinking With Withered Technology. ', u'Nintendo likes to combine technology that s been on the market for a while in new and different ways, and that philosophy has, historically, paid off for them. ', u'You can see it all over the Switch, with its cartridge based games building off of technology from the DS and 3DS, with the controller that splits in half to serve as a Wiimote, and so on. ', u'When Switch units hit the market and are taken apart by nerds who have to know how everything s assembled, it s likely going to be built from parts you find in many tablets.I', u'It s worth remembering that Nintendo still, even now, views itself as a toy company. ', u'The Switch is unlikely to be positioned as a direct competitor to the iPad and the litany of Android offerings. ', u'Similarly, the Switch may not be able to deliver to quite the level Nintendo is promising in this trailer. ', u'Still, consumers are more likely to view the Switch as a tablet more than a game console. ', u'And Apple, Google, and others should be keeping a very close eye on the Switch, or they might discover what many, many other companies have already learned the hard way: Just because Nintendo shows up late to a party doesn t mean it won t take it over.']

', u'The images end two days of speculation following the probe\'s unexpected radio silence less than a minute before the planned landing."', u'"Estimates are that Schiaparelli dropped from a height of between 2 and 4 kilometers (1.4-2.4 miles), therefore impacting at a considerable speed, greater than 300 kilometers per hour (186 mph)," the agency said.I', u'It said the large disturbance captured in the NASA photographs may have been caused by the probe\'s steep crash-landing, which would have sprayed matter around like a blast site on Earth."', u'"It is also possible that the lander exploded on impact, as its thruster propellant tanks were likely still full," the agency said.S', u'Schiaparelli was designed to test technology for a more ambitious European Mars landing in 2020.

", u"The first is a bright spot of about 12 meters diameter, likely to be Schiaparelli's parachute, ESA said.T", u'The second was described as "a fuzzy dark patch roughly 15 by 40 meters in size and about 1 kilometer north of the parachute" and is likely to be the lander."', u'"These preliminary interpretations will be refined following further analysis" and a high-resolution picture in the coming days, the agency said.W', u"While Schiaparelli was able to beam back some 600 megabytes of data before the crash, scientists won't get any of the close-up photos the probe took during its descent. ", u'Those were meant to be transmitted after the landing.E', u'ESA said the other part of the ExoMars mission   the Trace Gas Orbiter   was "working very well and will take science calibration data during two orbits in November." T', u'The spacecraft will then descend to an altitude of about 400 kilometers and begin its study of Mars next year.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   The Environmental Protection Agency had sufficient authority and information to issue an emergency order to protect residents of Flint, Michigan, from lead-contaminated water as early as June 2015   seven months before it declared an emergency, the EPA's inspector general said Thursday.T", u'The Flint crisis should have generated "a greater sense of urgency" at the agency to "intervene when the safety of drinking water is compromised," Inspector General Arthur Elkins said in an interim report.F', u"Flint's drinking water became tainted when the city began drawing from the Flint River in April 2014 to save money.

", u'Doctors have detected elevated levels of lead in hundreds of children.A', u'A panel appointed by Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder concluded that the state is "fundamentally accountable" for the lead crisis because of decisions made by state environmental regulators and state-appointed emergency managers who controlled the city.E', u'Even so, Snyder and other Republicans have faulted the EPA for a slow response."', u'"As Gov. Snyder has stated all along, what happened in Flint was the result of failure of government at all levels," spokeswoman Anna Heaton said Thursday.S', u'State agencies have undergone "culture changes" and updated procedures to prevent a recurrence, so "it\'s encouraging to see other agencies undergoing evaluations that can result in improvements to help people here and across the nation," Heaton said.F', u'The report calls that interpretation incorrect and says that under federal law, when state actions are deemed insufficient, "the EPA can and should proceed with an (emergency) order" aimed at "protecting the public in a timely manner."Without EPA intervention, "the conditions in Flint persisted, and the state continued to delay taking action to require corrosion control or provide alternative drinking water supplies," the report said.M', u'Michigan officials declared a public health emergency in October 2015; the EPA declared an emergency three months later.E', u'EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy has acknowledged that her agency should have been more aggressive in testing the water and requiring changes, but told Congress that officials "couldn\'t get a straight answer" from the state about what was being done in Flint.S', u'Spokeswoman Monica Lee said Thursday that EPA issued an order in the Flint case "as soon as it became apparent that the city and state were failing to address the serious problems with the Flint drinking water system."The director of the EPA\'s Midwest regional office stepped down Feb. 1 amid withering criticism that the agency failed to act sooner to address lead contamination in the predominantly African-American city.T', u'The official, Susan Hedman, denied wrongdoing, but said she was leaving to avoid becoming a distraction.I', u"In a memo from June 2015, Miguel Del Toral, a scientist in the EPA's Midwest office, had warned of dangerously high levels of lead.

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   The annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner, a white-tie gala in New York that is often the last time the two presidential nominees share a stage before Election Day, is traditionally a time when campaign hostilities are set aside.N', u'Not this year.D', u'Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton traded sharp barbs and brutal takedowns Thursday, the night after their final debate, with many in the well-heeled crowd turning on the Republican nominee midway through his remarks and showering him with jeers.T', u'Trump, who had drawn big laughs earlier in the speech, appeared to lose the room as he repeatedly dug in with caustic swipes at Clinton, drawing rare boos at a charity event meant to raise money for impoverished children throughout New York.H', u'He appeared to straddle the line when he talked about how "listening to Hillary rattle on and rattle on" has made him better appreciate his longtime nemesis Rosie O\'Donnell. ', u'But he then seemed to cross it when he referred to her as "corrupt" during a lengthy riff on the FBI\'s investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state."', u'"Hillary is so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission. How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission? Pretty corrupt," he said to loud boos and at least one call demanding he get off the stage.H', u'He then almost appeared to segue into the standard attack lines of his rally speeches, setting aside jokes to bring up material contained in hacked Clinton campaign emails."', u'"Hillary believes that it\'s vital to deceive the people by having one public policy and a totally different policy in private," he said to growing jeers. ', u'"Here she is tonight, in public, pretending not to hate Catholics."Clinton also veered into personal digs, making one joke in which she said the Statue of Liberty, for most Americans, represents a symbol of hope for immigrants."', u'"Donald looks at the Statue of Liberty and sees a \'4,\'" Clinton joked. ', u'"Maybe a \'5\' if she loses the torch and tablet and changes her hair."Trump and Clinton sat one seat apart for the evening, with New York\'s Cardinal Timothy Dolan acting as the only buffer. ', u'And when they entered and took their seats, they did not greet each other or make eye contact, though they did shake hands at the conclusion of the roast.D', u'Dolan later called his seat "the iciest place on the planet."Most eyes were on Trump, who infamously glowered through Obama\'s jokes at his expense during the 2011 White House Correspondents Dinner and is not known for being self-deprecating.S', u'Some of his jokes landed well, drawing laughs from both the crowd and Clinton.H', u'His biggest laughs came as he talked about Michelle Obama getting rave reviews for a recent speech. ', u'"They think she\'s absolutely great. My wife Melania gives the exact same speech, and people get on her case," he said to whoops and laughs.A', u'And some of his attack lines flashed a sense of humor that has been mostly absent from the grueling campaign. ', u'Clinton was the first one to laugh when Trump joked that she had bumped into him earlier in the night "and she very simply said \'Pardon me\'"   an unsubtle reference to the Republican nominee\'s frequent declarations that his opponent should go to jail.C', u'Clinton, meanwhile, was more self-deprecating than Trump, joking that she\'s taken a break from her "usual nap schedule" to attend and suggesting that the audience should be pleased she\'s not charging her usual fee for speaking in front of potential donors.B', u'But she also got in some digs at Trump, a few of which drew scattered jeers. ', u'Clinton said she understood why Trump was leery of teleprompters because they can be difficult to follow and "I\'m sure it\'s even harder when you\'re translating from the original Russian."The dinner is named after the former New York governor, who was the first Catholic to receive a major party nomination for president when he unsuccessfully ran in 1928. ', u'And fittingly for an event named after a man nicknamed "The Happy Warrior," the occasion has produced dozens of memorable presidential jokes   and sincere moments of goodwill that have remained largely absent from the 2016 campaign. ', u'"I can\'t wish my opponent luck," John McCain said in 2008, turning toward Obama, "but I do wish him well." ___ A', u'Associated Press writers Jill Colvin and Catherine Lucey contributed reporting. ___ R', u'Reach Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire ___ C', u"Chart the path Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton must take on the Road to 270 to reach the White House with AP's Electoral College interactive map: http://elections.ap.org/content/road-270-0"]

[u'Las Vegas (AFP) - The third and final debate of the caustic 2016 US presidential election started with a sober tone... but ended up with Donald Trump questioning the fundamental underpinnings of the nation. ', u'Here are four key moments:- November 9 -If Americans entered the debate concerned about what happens the day after this brutally fought election, Trump did little to assuage their fears.A', u'An hour into the 90-minute battle, the Republican nominee was asked whether he would respect the election result and concede if he lost. ', u'His answer will go into the history books."', u'"I\'ll look at it at the time. What I\'ve seen is so bad," he said, repeating unfounded allegations of vote rigging.F', u'Fellow Republicans rushed to denounce him, and his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton declared herself "appalled" by what she said was an attack on 240 years of US democracy.- Puppetry -Asked about embarrassing leaked emails, Clinton pivoted to Trump\'s much scrutinized relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Republican\'s refusal to pin the leaks on Moscow.C', u'Clinton suggested Putin wanted a "puppet" in the White House, which prompted a remarkable exchange."', u'"No puppet. No puppet," said Trump, talking over Clinton. ', u'"You\'re the puppet!""No, you\'re the puppet," he continued.C', u'Composing himself, Trump said "I never met Putin. This is not my best friend. But if the United States got along with Russia, it wouldn\'t be so bad."- \'Bad hombres\' -Both Clinton and Trump threw plenty of meat to their core political bases -- ticking boxes on guns, abortion and taxes.T', u'Trump was again on the defensive over his policy of forcibly deporting millions of illegal migrants."', u'"We have some bad hombres here, and we\'re going to get them out," he said.C', u'Clinton described that as an idea "that would rip our country apart."- Nasty woman -Some of the sharpest exchanges came when Trump accused Clinton and her campaign team of drumming up allegations that he has groped several women. ', u'"I believe," Trump said, "she got these people to step forward," accusing Clinton of running a "very sleazy campaign" and adding of the claims aired by several women dating back decades: "It was all fiction." T', u'Trump boasted, "I didn\'t even apologize to my wife," saying he did nothing wrong and so had nothing to apologize for. ', u'Later, when the topic turned to taxes, Clinton suggested that Trump might try to wriggle his way out of paying. ', u'"Such a nasty woman," Trump said, leaning into the microphone.']

[u'A top former Justice Department privacy officer on Wednesday called it  extremely unlikely  that a senior U.S. diplomat would normally discuss the nuances of classification levels of one of Hillary Clinton s emails about Benghazi with the deputy assistant director of the FBI s international operations bureau.P', u'Patrick Kennedy, the State Department s under secretary of management, was accused this week of entertaining a quid pro quo with the FBI in May 2015 regarding the classification of an email about the 2012 attack on a diplomatic compound in northern Libya. ', u'In exchange for the FBI keeping the email unclassified, the State Department would agree to host more FBI agents in Iraq, FBI documents suggested.U', u'Ultimately, the FBI did not accept Kennedy s proposal and maintained that the email should be classified. ', u'That classification decision was significant because the FBI had not yet launched its high-profile criminal investigation into the mishandling of classified information by Clinton and her aides. ', u'Had no classified information been found on Clinton s homebrew server, there would have likely been no criminal investigation of the Democratic presidential nominee.B', u'Both the FBI and the State Department have denied any quid pro quo. ', u'But the Justice Department s former information and privacy director, Dan Metcalfe, on Wednesday said it was  extremely unlikely  that the Kennedy would seek advice on this particular classification issue from now-retired FBI agent Brian McCauley, who at the time was the bureau s deputy assistant director for international operations.I', u'Instead, Metcalfe suggested, Kennedy likely called knowing the FBI wanted more agents in Iraq, but had been stymied in the past. ', u'Far more likely is that it was attempted exploitation of the fact that Mr. McCauley had been unable to get his phone calls returned on his request for Mr. Kennedy s approval of additional FBI personnel in Iraq,  Metcalfe told Foreign Policy.K', u'Kennedy has denied the two issues were linked in any way. ', u'There was no quid pro quo, nor was there any bargaining,  he said Tuesday. ', u'He said he merely wanted to  better understand a proposal the FBI made to upgrade  the classification of one of Clinton s emails before it was publicly released.M', u'McCauley told the and  he had sought for weeks to get State Department approval to send two FBI employees to Baghdad. ', u'In May 2015, Kennedy finally called back.O', u'Other former Justice officials and FOIA experts also questioned why Kennedy would reach out to McCauley, of all people, to  better understand  the bureau s views on the specific classification decision. ', u'There is no way that Mr. Kennedy contacted the Deputy Assistant Director of International Operations to understand a proposed FBI classification decision, which would be made by an entirely different component of the FBI,  said Kel McClanahan, the executive director of National Security Counselors, an organization that specializes in litigation and FOIA requests to acquire government documents related to national security. ', u'The only reason Mr. Kennedy, who would be very familiar with this office and its area of expertise, would contact Mr. McCauley, would be to discuss international operations, in this case, the placement of FBI agents in Baghdad. ', u'Bradley Moss, a Washington lawyer specializing in national security and disclosure law, added that the  explanation just doesn t make sense. ', u'McCauley would not be the logical person for Kennedy to approach on the classification matter at all, unless he erroneously thought McCauley (as an international operations guy) would have some understanding of FBI s classification justification for an email implicating Benghazi,  he told FP in an email.S', u'State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner disputed that theory and said McCauley did have relevant expertise on classification issues related to the Clinton email. ', u'Because the subject matter of the email in question was related to arrests abroad, it made total sense for Under Secretary Kennedy to reach out to the Deputy Assistant Director for International Operations who would have had the subject matter expertise as to whether this email needed to be classified,  said Toner.B', u'But in McCauley s account about the conversation,  Tuesday in , Kennedy was not seeking the agent s guidance on a classification issue. ', u'Rather, he wanted McCauley to influence his colleagues that were in a position to make the classification decision. ', u'I had no idea what the task was, what [Kennedy] was seeking,  McCauley said. ', u'I didn t even know what he was asking for. ', u'McCauley said that it was only when he followed up with a colleague who worked in the bureau s records division that he learned that the classification involved Benghazi.O', u'Other transparency advocates give Kennedy the benefit of the doubt. ', u'It s not unusual to have informal interagency contact to address FOIA issues, and it appears that s what happened here,  said Norm Eisen, a former Obama administration official and cofounder of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a government watchdog group. ', u'Others said that Kennedy s actions don t point to a specific fire, but say there s an awful lot of smoke. ', u'If Pat Kennedy had a long-existing professional relationship with Brian McCauley there might be nothing unusual or suspicious about reaching out to him on a classification issue,  said Anne Weismann, who worked on government information litigation at the Justice Department from 1995 to 2002. ', u'I am troubled by the reporting suggesting Kennedy reached out to multiple FBI officials on reclassifying an email,  she added. ', u'It would be unusual if Kennedy was shopping the email around the Bureau and his request to have it declassified. ', u'Republicans have seized on the quid pro quo claims in recent days with GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump demanding Kennedy be fired. ', u'On Monday, the Republican chairmen of the House Oversight and Intelligence committees also  on Kennedy to resign. ', u'Those who receive classified intelligence should not barter in it   that is reckless behavior with our nation s secrets,  the chairmen said in a statement. ', u'While Republicans have accused Kennedy of trying to protect Clinton, Kennedy himself also stood to gain by avoiding an investigation into her private email server. ', u'As the under secretary of management, Kennedy oversees both records management and the IT department at the State Department. ', u'He previously faced criticism from Congress for not standing in Clinton s way when she decided to use a private email server during her time in office, an arrangement that risked exposing classified secrets to foreign adversaries and concealing her correspondence from legitimate public disclosure requests. ', u'Though interagency contacts are frequent for records issues, Kennedy s broad portfolio would generally preclude him from getting involved in mundane questions of security classification, experts said. ', u'If it was simply a FOIA issue, there is no reason for Mr. Kennedy to get involved  unless he is attempting to cut a deal,  said McClanahan. ', u'Yes, the FOIA office is under his authority, but so is HR, Diplomatic Security, IT, and numerous other offices. ', u'Do you really expect him to personally contact someone at the FBI to inquire about a particular interagency detail or database issue? ', u'This story has been updated.']

[u'NEWARK, N.J. (AP)   New Jersey Gov.

', u"But 2016 isn't over yet and Apple has one more event planned before the year is through.T", u"This event isn't anticipated quite as eagerly as other recent Apple events, mainly because Apple's Mac lineup is expected to be the focus.

[u"It's been a long time since we've seen Apple roll out a revamped and next-gen MacBook Pro. ", u"In fact, the entirety of Apple's Mac lineup has been in dire need of a meaningful refresh for an embarrassingly long time.T", u"Thankfully, we won't have to endure Apple's stale and stagnant Mac lineup for much longer. ", u'Earlier this week, Apple sent out invitations for a special media event set to take place on October 27. ', u"Apple, in typical fashion, hasn't told us what's on the agenda but it's no secret that the event will focus primarily on new Macs. ", u"It's also no secret that the star of the show will be a completely retooled MacBook Pro with a number of snazzy new bells and whistles.I", u"If you've been in the market for a new Mac, you certainly won't want to miss next week's event. ", u"And to get you primed for what will hopefully be some compelling new products, we've put together a list highlighting everything we know about Apple's upcoming MacBook Pro.F", u"First things first, the killer feature on Apple's 2016 MacBook Pro will reportedly be the addition of an OLED display panel located towards the top of the keyboard. ", u"Rather than expanding the existing keyboard, it's believed that the OLED panel will be located where the function keys typically reside.T", u"This past May, photos purporting to be from Apple's new MacBook Pro leaked online and, surprise surprise, note the empty space where the function row keys usually are.A", u'As to the inherent advantages of such a design, an OLED display on the keyboard would allow the keys to dynamically change to more appropriately fit whatever app you happen to be using.A', u'As an illustrative example, designer Martin Hajek earlier this year produced a number of tantalizing concept images which showcase how the feature might operate.T', u'The images below, for example, show what the OLED display might look like with Spotify running.T', u'These are just concepts, remember, but the possibilities of an OLED display offering up app-specific shortcuts is certainly compelling. ', u'All the more intriguing are reports that users will have the ability to customize app-specific shortcuts to their liking. ', u"Late this August, the French site Consomac unearthed code from Apple's Pages app which strongly hints that the shortcuts on the OLED display -- which Apple internally calls the Dynamic Function Row -- can be tweaked by users. ", u'Imagine, for example, selecting a block of text and with the tap of a button instantly formatting it to your liking without having to go sifting through a maze of menus.W', u'We would imagine that Apple will have more appealing examples to show us come next Thursday.A', u"Another intriguing detail about Apple's forthcoming MacBook Pro models is that they will have Touch ID integrated into the keyboard itself. ", u'This should be particularly useful given that users running Mac OS Sierra can now take advantage of Apple Pay on the web.A', u"As for other details, Apple's new MacBook Pro will reportedly be a little bit thinner than its predecessor, will feature a larger trackpad, and will include a keyboard based on the butterfly mechanism Apple first introduced us to with the 12-inch MacBook. ", u'If this particular rumor pans out, expect the keys on the new MacBook Pro to have a slightly larger surface area.A', u'Apple touts the benefits of its butterfly mechanism thusly: Traditional keyboards use a scissor mechanism, which tends to wobble around the edges. ', u'This creates a lack of precision when you strike anywhere except the center of the key. ', u'We needed to reduce key wobbling for a keyboard this thin; otherwise, striking a key off-center could result in the keycap hitting bottom before a keystroke registers. ', u'So we designed a unique butterfly mechanism, which is wider than the scissor mechanism and has a single assembly made from a stiffer material   allowing for a more stable, responsive key that takes up less vertical space. ', u'This innovative design improves stability, uniformity, and control   no matter where you press on the key. ', u"Additionally, don't be surprised if the trackpad on the new MacBook Pro is completely stationary a'la Apple's current 12-inch MacBook.A", u'As far as ports are concerned, consumers can likely kiss the beloved MagSafe adapter and traditional USB ports goodbye and instead say hello to new USB-C and Thuderbolt 3 ports. ', u'While Apple may very well just include one USB-C port, one would imagine that Apple would outfit its Pro notebook with more than just USB-C port.W', u'With respect to internals, we can naturally expect to see some great speed and graphics improvements. ', u'Specifically, the new MacBook Pros will reportedly house Intel Skylake processors which should make the machines much more power efficient, a welcome perk on a Pro device that will likely be used as a workhorse by many. ', u"On the graphics front, don't be surprised to see a GPU which takes advantage of AMD's Polaris architecture.S", u'Size wise, Apple will reportedly release two MacBook Pro models, one in a 13-inch form factor and another in a 15-inch form factor. ', u'While there was some concern that Apple might do away with the headphone jack on its new MacBook Pros, the leaked chasis below should help alleviate any concerns in that regard. ', u"Last and not least, expect to see Apple's revamped MacBook Pro hit store shelves in 2016, presumably before the busy holiday shopping season kicks off. ", u'Trending right now:']

[u'DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP)   The U.N. agency devoted to preserving world heritage has joined environmental groups urging Bangladesh to halt plans for a massive coal-fired power plant near ecologically sensitive mangrove forests on the coast.

With upstream dams and heavy demand for agriculture, the amount of freshwater that reaches the bay   and protects against saltwater incursion   has already fallen drastically, experts say.E', u"Earlier this month, Bangladesh offered a response to UNESCO's preliminary report, saying it would continue construction with the latest technologies and following international guidelines to ensure it did not harm the Sundarbans.A", u'A report in June by a global energy research institute disputed that, saying the Rampal power plant is "fraught with unacceptable risk" including a location that falls within a cyclone corridor, heavy local opposition and a risk of higher taxes and energy prices to cover some $3 billion in planned subsidies."', u'Bangladesh insists, however, that the plant is key to reaching its target of 24 GW of electricity capacity by 2021.

", u"Whereas the iPhone is seemingly criticized for minute and arguably petty reasons, some of the Google Pixel's shortcomings were curiously and conveniently glossed over with gusto.T", u'Touching on this very point, Rene Ritchie has a  where he explains how the Pixel was graded by tech reviewers on curiously favorable curve.

', u'Consequently, one would imagine that the Pixel would be held up to the same level of scrutiny as the iPhone.A', u'Alas, this was hardly the case.T', u'The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was lambasted mercilessly, and rightfully so given those unsightly antenna lines.

Meanwhile, if Apple doesn\'t introduce a groundbreaking new iPhone design every year, it\'s a sign that there\'s trouble in Cupertino.

", u"I'm not saying that Apple should be immune from criticism, but it'd be nice if other companies, especially big players like Google, were held to the same set of expectations and standards that Apple has to live up to.

[u"NEW YORK (AP)   Could millions of connected cameras, thermostats and kids' toys bring the internet to its knees? ", u"It's beginning to look that way.O", u'On Friday, epic cyberattacks crippled a major internet firm, repeatedly disrupting the availability of popular websites across the United States. ', u"The hacker group claiming responsibility says that the day's antics were just a dry run and that it has its sights set on a much bigger target. ", u'And the attackers now have a secret weapon in the increasing array of internet-enabled household devices they can subvert and use to wreak havoc.M', u'MEET THE FIRE HOSEManchester, New Hampshire-based Dyn Inc. said its server infrastructure was hit by distributed denial-of-service, or DDoS, attacks. ', u'These work by overwhelming targeted machines with junk data traffic   sort of like knocking someone over by blasting them with a fire hose. ', u'The attack temporarily blocked some access to popular websites from across America and Europe such as Twitter, Netflix and PayPal.J', u'Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, owned by Gartner Inc., said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday affecting access to many sites from the East Coast. ', u'A second attack later in the day spread disruption to the West Coast as well as some users in Europe.M', u'Members of a shadowy hacker group that calls itself New World Hackers claimed responsibility for the attack via Twitter, though that claim could not be verified. ', u"They said they organized networks of connected devices to create a massive botnet that threw a monstrous 1.2 trillion bits of data every second at Dyn's servers. ", u"Dyn officials wouldn't confirm the figure during a conference call later Friday with reporters.M", u'MAKE THAT, MANY FIRE HOSESDDoS attacks have been growing in frequency and size in recent months. ', u"But if the hackers' claims are true, Friday's attacks take DDoS to a new level. ", u'According to a report from the cybersecurity firm Verisign, the largest DDoS attack perpetrated during the second quarter of this year peaked at just 256 billion bits per second.A', u"A huge September attack that shut down of security journalist Brian Krebs' website clocked in at 620 billion bits per second. ", u'Research from the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint said Friday that the same kind of malware was used in the attacks against both Krebs and Dyn.L', u'Lance Cottrell, chief scientist for the cybersecurity firm Ntrepid, said while DDoS attacks have been used for years, they\'ve become very popular in recent months, thanks to the proliferation of "internet of things" devices ranging from connected thermostats to security cameras and smart TVs. ', u'Many of those devices feature little in the way of security, making them easy targets for hackers.T', u'The power of this kind of cyberattack is limited by the number of devices an attacker can connect to. ', u'Just a few years ago, most attackers were limited to infecting and recruiting "zombie" home PCs. ', u'But the popularity of new internet-connected gadgets has vastly increased the pool of potential devices they can weaponize. ', u'The average North American home contains 13 internet-connected devices , according to the research firm IHS Markit.S', u"Since the attacks usually don't harm the consumer electronics companies that build the devices, or the consumers that unwittingly use them, companies have little incentive to boost security, Cottrell said.W", u"WHAT'S BEHIND THE ATTACKSLike with other online attacks, the motivation behind DDoS attacks is usually mischief or money. ", u'Attackers have shut down websites in the past to make political statements. ', u"DDoS attacks have also been used in extortion attempts, something that's been made easier by the advent of Bitcoin.F", u'For its part, a member of New World Hackers who identified themselves as "Prophet" told an AP reporter via Twitter direct message exchange that collective isn\'t motivated by money and doesn\'t have anything personal against Dyn, Twitter or any of the other sites affected by the attacks. ', u'Instead, the hacker said, the attacks were merely a test, and claimed that the next target will be the Russian government for committing alleged cyberattacks against the U.S. earlier this year."', u'"Twitter was kind of the main target. It showed people who doubted us what we were capable of doing, plus we got the chance to see our capability," said "Prophet." The claims couldn\'t be verified.T', u'The collective has in the past claimed responsibility for similar attacks against sites including ESPNFantasySports.com in September and the BBC on Dec. 31. ', u"The attack on the BBC marshalled half the computing power of Friday's attacks.A", u'A SHIFTING GLOBAL ASSAULTDyn said it first became aware of an attack around 7:00 a.m. local time, focused on data centers on the East Coast of the U.S. ', u'Services were restored about two hours later. ', u'But then attackers shifted to offshore data centers, and the latest wave of problems continued until Friday evening Eastern time. ', u'"Prophet" told the AP that his group actually had stopped its attacks by Friday afternoon, but that others, including members of the hacker collective known as Anonymous, had picked up where they left off. ', u"Anonymous didn't respond to a request for comment via Twitter. ", u'Department of Homeland Security is monitoring the situation, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Friday. ', u'He said he had no information about who may be behind the disruption. ', u'Cottrell noted that there are several firms that offer protection against DDoS attacks, by giving companies a way to divert the bad traffic and remain online in case of an attack. ', u'But monthly subscription fees for these services are generally equal to a typical DDoS extortion payment, giving companies little incentive to pay for them. ', u'Meanwhile not much is required in the way of resources or skill to mount a botnet attack, he said, adding that would-be attackers can rent botnets for as little as $100. ', u'Cottrell said the long-term solution lies in improving the security of all internet-connected devices. ___ T', u'This story has been corrected to note that the DDoS attack on the site of security journalist Brian Krebs hit 620 billion bits per second, not million. ___ F', u'Follow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler .

[u'Beyond damages, the alleged Native American victims are seeking a written apology, help for other participants of the program who were abused, and changes to the LDS Church s sex-abuse policy. ', u'The alleged victims claim the Church still does more to protect its leaders than its children: The Church instructs those who learn about sexual abuse to call a Mormon help line instead of immediately alerting the police or other outside authorities. ', u'Eric Hawkins, a Church spokesperson, said the help line exists because  reporting requirements vary from state to state, and the purpose of the conversation is to help ensure that it does occur in the right way the way that cares for the victim and stops the abuse. ', u'For example, in some cases  there may be questions about providing a safe place for the victim to live following reporting,  Hawkins said.A', u'A 16-year-old Native American girl named Helen John was the inspiration for the Indian Student Placement Program, said Garrett. ', u'John and her family were farm laborers in Richfield, Utah. ', u'In 1947, according to Church tradition, John asked to stay with a local Mormon family so that she could receive a better education. ', u'The program grew informally from there and became an official Church-sponsored program in 1954.T', u'These lawsuits fit into a larger pattern of sexual-abuse allegations against religious institutions.T', u'The children who participated in the Mormon foster program were often poor with few educational opportunities. ', u'Although the LDS Church reached out to dozens of Indian tribes, most participants  families lived within the Navajo Nation, a region that stretches into parts of Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. ', u'At the time, many of the boarding schools run by the U.S. ', u'Bureau of Indian Affairs and schools on Indian reservations had little to offer, according to scholars and former members of the program. ', u'As in John s case, the Native American families who signed up for the program frequently said they had their kids  education in mind, as did many of the Mormon foster families who were willing to temporarily adopt the children.O', u'Once the program began,  there were all sorts of really questionable tactics used  to bring in participants, said Garrett, who wrote Making Lamanites: Mormons, Native Americans, and the Indian Student Placement Program, 1947-2000. ', u'He said there are conflicting accounts about whether it was even John s idea or desire to live with a Mormon family. ', u'Because some missionaries were eager to grow Church membership through the program, Garrett said, they sometimes failed to be completely transparent with the children they were recruiting: Occasionally missionaries acted as if the children were simply embarking on some kind of field trip.S', u'Spencer W. Kimball, a former president and apostle of the Church, was one of the first proponents of the Indian Student Placement Program. ', u'Kimball believed the program fit into the Church s overall mandate to help Native Americans. ', u'The Lord bless the Lamanite people. ', u'They are a great people. ', u'They are intelligent, and I repeat my theme song: The difference between them and us is opportunity,  Kimball said in 1953 at the Church s general conference. ', u'Kimball seemed to take the Book of Mormon literally, believing that, as the children in the program grew closer to God, the curse associated with a  skin of blackness  would slowly disappear. ', u'Speaking at the Church s general conference in 1960, Kimball explained:The children in the home-placement program in Utah are often lighter than their brothers and sisters in the hogans [traditional Navajo dwellings] on the reservation. ', u'At one meeting a father and mother and their 16-year-old daughter were present, the little member girl 16 sitting between the dark father and mother, and it was evident she was several shades lighter than her parents on the same reservation, in the same hogan, subject to the same sun and wind and weather. ', u'There was the doctor in a Utah city who for two years had an Indian boy in his home who stated that he was some shades lighter than the younger brother just coming into the program from the reservation. ', u'These young members of the Church are changing to whiteness and to delightsomeness.T', u'Today, many people would consider these views racist: They suggest that lighter skin is a sign of righteousness. ', u'But Clarence Bishop, the director of the program from 1964 to 1968 and executive director from 1968 to 1973, argued that the program was never meant to undermine Native American culture. ', u'He said he and others were aware of concerns about the program and sensitive to the indigenous way of life. ', u'We did everything we could to help them in their Indian identity and still have the benefit and knowledge of living in a good home and going to a public school,  Bishop said. ', u'No Indian student was ever kept in a home where they were not happy. ', u'In addition to the claims of damage done by sexual abuse, the lawsuits involving the Indian Student Placement Program assert that the culture of the Navajo Nation was  irreparably harmed  by the LDS Church s  continuous and systematic assimilation efforts. ', u'Although the last student in the Indian Student Placement Program graduated in 2000, plaintiffs are asking the Church to do all it can to enhance and restore Navajo culture and create a taskforce for that purpose.T', u'The plaintiffs  lawyer said many Mormons continue to mislead Native Americans about their origins. ', u'Arguably, Mormons often looked at Native Americans in the same way the rest of the world does. ', u'Mormon people are not unique in how they see Native people,  said Elise Boxer, a history professor at the University of South Dakota. ', u'Many believe  assimilation is key to their racial uplift as a people. ', u'Boxer said some Native Americans who convert to Mormonism even embrace the Lamanite story.A', u'And there s no question that many program participants viewed their experiences positively. ', u'When Cal Nez now a 58-year-old resident of Sandy, Utah was a child, he was raised by his Navajo grandmother. ', u'During that time, Nez was placed with two different Mormon foster families, and while his initial experience was not entirely positive, he said, living with his second foster family was  absolutely the most magnificent experience. ', u'Nez excelled in school, and in high school was voted both student of the year and most popular. ', u'He also said the Lamanite story found in the Book of Mormon made him feel better about himself. ', u'Of all the religions, the only religion that really gave me an identity of where I come from was the LDS Church. ', u'And it was so powerful,  Nez said. ', u'Nez credits the Indian Student Placement Program with his continued success today as a graphic designer and a small-business owner.I', u'In 1976, the Association of Administrators of the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children a non-government group that monitors foster placements across state lines  sent surveys to 50 Native American families who had participated in the program. ', u"The results were mostly positive: 93 percent believed their children would receive a better education as a result of the program, and 70 percent said they felt their children's foster family helped them understand and identify with their Indian heritage. ", u'In 2014, Jessie Embry, a former history professor now retired from Brigham Young University, conducted an oral-history project that focused on the foster parents in the program. ', u'I found that the host families in the Placement Program articulated a genuine love for the Indian people and a desire to help them,  she wrote, after receiving responses from nearly 200 foster families. ', u'Many of the foster families, Embry said in a recent interview,  felt the Book of Mormon gave them an assignment to be able to help the Native Americans. ', u'But some of the foster families Embry contacted admitted there were problems, including sexual abuse, although the foster family wasn t always responsible for the alleged wrongdoing. ', u'One interviewee spoke about a placement student abusing one of his biological children. ', u'This person also expressed frustration with a lack of response from the Mormon caseworker and discovered that the placement student had abused other children in previous homes.O', u'One interviewee spoke about a placement student abusing one of his biological children.B', u'BN, one of the plaintiffs involved in the sexual-abuse lawsuits against the Church, has also alleged in her lawsuit that her Mormon caseworker did not respond to her complaints. (She requested not to be named in this story. Her name is also not included in the lawsuit, because of the sensitive nature of her claims.) In a recent interview, she said her father wanted her to be part of the program so that she could attend high school outside of the reservation and graduate from college. ', u'She joined the program in 1964 and quickly regretted it, she said. ', u'So many times I wanted to tell my dad,  No,   BN said. ', u'I wanted to say, but I didn t. I just kind of held everything in. BN s first year in the program passed without incident. ', u'But the following year, BN lived with a different Mormon family in River Heights, Utah. ', u'There, according to the lawsuit, she was sexually abused by her foster father. ', u'She also claims that years later, while living with a different foster family, a foster brother raped her. ', u'She alleged in her lawsuit that she told her foster parents and a caseworker, who is anonymous in the suit, about what had happened, but the abuse continued. ', u'To save face in the Church and out of anger, he just told me what happens in this house, stays in this house,  BN said, referring to her foster father. ', u'There was nothing that was done. ', u'It just fell on deaf ears. ', u'One former caseworker in the program who is not involved in the suit, 85-year-old Dale L. Shumway of Orem, Utah, said in all his years of service he remembers only one student coming to him about a foster family s inappropriate behavior. ', u'These families were quite carefully selected,  Shumway said. ', u'It was not a haphazard program. ', u'Shumway said he visited foster families on a monthly basis and that students would have had ample opportunity to report any abuse to caseworkers or other Church leaders. ', u'But he also said that he and others were assigned large caseloads, sometimes tracking 80 to 90 families. ', u'Jordan, the Church s lawyer, maintained that  participants in the Indian Student Placement Program met regularly with caseworkers and would have had the opportunity to raise any concerns they might have. ', u'Vernon, the lawyer representing BN and others, grew up Mormon. ', u'He said he expects there will be additional sexual-abuse lawsuits involving the Indian Student Placement Program. ', u'BN, for example, had not previously filed suit against the Church or her alleged abusers; Vernon said she only had the courage to bring a case after someone else in the program did so first. ', u'I think this is the tip of the iceberg,  he said. (Efforts to reach the alleged abusers and their families were unsuccessful; in the suits, they are often identified only by a first initial and town name. Lawyers for the Church refused to provide further information about the alleged abusers.)  The location where the cases are litigated will prove crucial. ', u'These lawsuits have been filed in Navajo Nation District Court in Window Rock, Arizona. ', u'But the LDS Church is fighting to have the lawsuits dismissed on jurisdictional grounds, arguing the alleged abuse took place outside the reservation. ', u'The Navajo Nation allows alleged sexual-abuse victims to bring claims up to two years from the time when the harm of their abuse is discovered, accounting for the time it can take for people to realize the nature of their injuries. ', u'Other jurisdictions have stricter statutes of limitations to ensure claims are brought in a timely manner. ', u'In Utah s civil courts, the statute of limitations for child sex abuse was recently eliminated, but only when the case is brought against the alleged perpetrator personally. ', u'The recent change in Utah law would not benefit those in the Indian Student Placement Program because the LDS Church is named as a defendant, and many, if not all, of the perpetrators are deceased. ', u'If the lawsuits were refiled in Utah, or one of many other states with a shorter statute of limitations, they would likely be dismissed. ', u'David Clohessy, the national director of the Survivor s Network of Those Abused by Priests, an organization dedicated to helping victims of sexual abuse, said it often takes years for those affected by abuse to talk about it. ', u'The more isolated and powerlessness victims   feel, the longer it takes for them to come forward,  Clohessy said. ', u'And  even if they had the smarts to understand they were being hurt, the courage to report it, given how many whites felt about Native Americans, many would find these boys and girls not particularly credible   This particular program is a predator s dream. ', u'In recent years, Mormons have begun to reassess their relationship with Native Americans. ', u'Church leaders have changed some of the language in the Book of Mormon that many find problematic, arguing that passages that seem to refer to skin color were never meant to be taken literally. ', u'For example, in 1981, a passage referring to the Lamanites as becoming  a white and a delightsome people  was changed to read  pure and delightsome. ', u'The Church also now admits that not all Native Americans are descendants of the Israelites, or Lamanites, as described in the Book of Mormon. ', u'However, the continued fallout from the Indian Student Placement Program indicates that some Native Americans feel the LDS Church has not done enough to correct past misconceptions about indigenous people. ', u'In fact, the LDS Church maintains that one sign of the Second Coming can be found among the descendents of the Lamanites: when Native Americans once again become a righteous people and  blossom as the rose.

', u'How does this attack work, and what does it do?T', u"The culprit behind the outage is what's known as a distributed denial-of-service attack, or DDoS, which was mounted against a company called Dyn DNS. ", u"It's one of the more common types of cyberattack, though today's incident was a bit more widespread than usual, because most attacks focus on one site. ", u'One of the largest DDoS attacks ever targeted the BBC sites and its on-demand media service, reported The Hacker News.A', u'A DDoS attack works by essentially overloading the target server with requests to connect. ', u'This is not unlike overwhelming a receptionist at a big company with phone calls, bombarding the phone lines with calls. [The 8 Craziest Intelligence Leaks in US History]Ordinarily, a phone call comes in, and it can be directed to the right person or extension. ', u'Sometimes, lots of calls come in and a secretary can put you on hold before eventually connecting the call. ', u'But now, imagine if the number of those incoming calls goes way up. ', u"The poor receptionist can't field all of the calls at the same time, so lots of people would end up on hold for longer periods of time, while other callers wouldn't be able to get through at all, because all the lines are busy.W", u'With a DDoS attack, replace phone calls with requests to connect to a website via the internet. ', u'Essentially, the server gets overwhelmed. ', u'The "distributed" part of the acronym is because the requests can come from many places, and, as the name suggests, and can deny the website\'s service to others. ', u'DDoS attacks can take a number of forms, but the basic principle is the same: take up all the bandwidth with lots of traffic.T', u'To mount a DDoS cyberattack, a hacker needs lots of machines that are set to make a request. ', u'One way to get lots of requests to a website is to send out a bot. ', u'A bot (short for "robot") is a program that will do things automatically, such as try to connect to a website, or carry out some computing tasks. ', u"Bots have a lot of legitimate uses in distributed computing, such as when there's a task that no one machine can handle on its own. ", u'But, bots have become more famous in recent years for their use in cyberattacks.O', u'One way to distribute a bot to many computers is via a virus, or malware, according to Incapsula, one of many providers of Internet security and DDoS defense. ', u"Such malware can operate in the background and the infected computer user isn't even aware of what's happening.T", u"There are also voluntary DDoS attacks, such as what's known as a Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC), according to Radware. ", u'This is a simple program that\'s designed to flood servers with connection requests and it\'s often used to "stress test" networks. ', u'LOIC has also been used for more malicious means, including by the hackers group Anonymous when they used the program to attack the Recording Industry Association of America site in 2010. ', u"LOIC is considered to be a relatively primitive program now, because the kinds of attacks it mounts aren't always distributed and can thus be traced to a single IP address   in other words, a single computer. ", u"But, the principle is the same one that's used in more sophisticated hacks. [Best Hacks by the Hacktivist Group 'Anonymous']In the case of today's DDoS attack, though, more than one website was affected. ", u'This is because instead of flooding a single site with connection requests, the attacker went after Dyn, which provides part of the Domain Name System, or DNS. ', u'The DNS is the directory that your computer connects with to match a website name   for instance, Google.com   to a string of numbers, which is the IP address (similar to the way you look up a phone number by name in a phone book).A', u"An attacker flooded Dyn with traffic, which overwhelmed the company's ability to handle it. ", u"As such, whenever a user tried to connect to Twitter, for instance, he or she wasn't able to do it, even though Twitter itself was still operational. ", u'Another way to think about it is if you went to a library to look up a number in a phone book, but someone hired a bunch of people to grab all the copies before you could get there.A', u'As of Friday afternoon it appears the attacks are ongoing, though the exact details have yet to be determined.O', u'Original article on Live Science.E', u"Editor's Recommendations"]

', u'How has this approach differed from the way it was done in previous years?C', u'CR has changed the way it presents reliability data, beginning with the 2005 survey. ', u'In previous surveys, the symbol for each trouble spot represented a specific range of problem rates. ', u'This allowed readers to make direct comparisons in the rate at which people reported problems in different trouble spots and in different ages of cars. ', u'However, this previous approach made it difficult for readers to make sense of whether a particular trouble spot was better or worse than average, and in some cases, it limited our ability to identify unusually reliable or unreliable cars. ', u"Also, the Used Car Verdict and Predicted Reliability are relative values that compare a vehicle's reliability record to the average model of the same age. ", u'The absolute scale of the trouble spots and the relative scale of the Verdict caused some confusion and frequent questions. ', u'So we changed our analysis in order to represent the data in a way that would be more clear and useful to readers. ', u'In our new approach, scores are assigned separately within each trouble spot for models of each model year. ', u'For each trouble spot, we calculate the mean problem rate of all models of the same age, and then assign scores to an individual model based on how that model compares with the mean. ', u'In this new approach, a  or a  always represents a model with more problems than the average model of that age; and a  represents a model with fewer problems than average. (There is an exception in the newer model years, in which most trouble spots have very low problem rates. In those cases, even the average problem rate is excellent, and  represents that average.)  ', u'What is the Used Car Verdict?T', u"The Used Car Verdict summarizes a model's reliability over all 17 trouble spots. ", u'Because problems with the engine major, cooling, transmission-major, and drive system can be serious and more expensive to repair, our calculation gives extra weight to problems in these areas. ', u'The Verdict scores show whether the model had more or fewer problems overall than the average model of that year. ', u'What is Predicted Reliability?T', u'The Predicted Reliability, also called New Car Prediction, forecasts how well a new model that is currently on sale is likely to hold up based on its recent history. ', u"For this Rating, we average a model's Used Car Verdict for the newest three years, provided the vehicle did not change significantly in that time and hasn't been redesigned for the upcoming model year. ", u'Over the years, we have found that several years of data are a better predictor than the most recent model year alone. ', u'One or two years of data may be used if the model was redesigned within that three-year time frame, or if there were insufficient data for some years. ', u'We will make a prediction for a brand new or  redesigned model, or a model with insufficient data, based on the manufacturer s track record, history of the previous generation, or similar models that shared the same components. ', u'Of course, this is only a prediction, and these scores are not a guarantee of the reliability of any individual car. ', u'However, buying a car that has an above-average score for Predicted Reliability will reduce the likelihood of having significant problems with your car. ', u"You can find our Predicted Reliability for new cars in many of Consumer Reports' auto publications, including the April Annual Auto Issue, CR monthly road tests, our special new-car publications and online at ConsumerReports.org. ", u'How do you decide on Reliable Used Cars and Used Cars to Avoid?E', u'Each year, we list the best and worst used cars from the current survey, usually a few months after the new cars have been updated. ', u'Reliable Used Cars are specific models with above average overall reliability, based on the Used Car Verdict for that model. ', u'To help you choose a reliable used car that meets your budget, we list Reliable Used Cars in price categories, from less than $10,000 to $20,000-$25,000. ', u'Within each car type and price range, models are listed alphabetically by make, model and year. ', u"We also compile a Best of the best list, CR Good Bets, which are models that have had consistently better-than-average reliability for multiple years, and performed well in CR's tests when they were new. ", u'Note that just because a model is not listed as a Reliable Used Car or a CR Good Bet does not mean that it is necessarily unreliable it may be the case that we do not have sufficient data to assess its reliability, or that we do not have a recent enough road test. ', u'Why are there sometimes considerable differences in reliability between "related" or "twin" models?S', u'Some variants of similar vehicles have different reliability results in our survey. ', u'Although you might expect that related vehicles, or "twin" models, would have very similar reliability histories, there are a number of factors that can lead owners to have different reliability experiences with these models. ', u'Some differences can be attributed to different equipment, such as different suspension tuning, or power equipment. ', u'Some related models may be manufactured in different plants. ', u'While their designs might be quite similar, by being built in separate facilities they may be subject to different manufacturing processes, such as differences in quality control. ', u'Some related models that share the same powertrain but have other differences such as model introduction at different times, may have different reliability. ', u'Models that are introduced later may benefit from solving of initial problems of the related model that was introduced earlier. ', u'We carefully examine the data for all related models, and if the data show that their reliability profiles are similar, we will combine their data to yield more robust results. ', u'We believe, though, in the accuracy of our data, and we have a commitment to report the experiences our subscribers share with us. ', u'In some cases, they report different reliability experiences with closely related models. ', u"How Can CR's Information Help Me Buy a Reliable Car?B", u'Buying a reliable new carNew car buyers can get an idea of how a model that is currently on sale is likely to hold up by looking at the New Car Prediction. ', u"For this Rating, we averaged a model's Used Car Verdict for the newest three model years, provided the vehicle did not change significantly in that time and has not been redesigned for the new model year. ", u'We have found that three years of data are a better predictor than the most recent model year alone. ', u'One or two years of data may be used if the model was redesigned in recently, or if there were insufficient data for some years. ', u'We will make a prediction for a brand new or redesigned model, or a model with insufficient data, based on the manufacturer s track record, history of the previous generation, or similar models that shared the same components. ', u"While reliability history is no guarantee of a new car's reliability, by choosing a car that has been relatively problem-free for owners of recent models, you can improve your odds of having a problem-free car. ", u'Buying a reliable used carIf you want to check on the reliability of a particular used car, start with the Used Car Verdict. ', u'This score shows whether the model had more or fewer problems overall than the average model of that year, calculated from the total number of problems reported by subscribers in all 17 trouble spots. ', u'Because problems with the engine-major, transmission-major, engine cooling, and drive system can be serious and expensive to repair, our calculations give extra weight to problems in those areas. ', u"If you aren't sure which models to consider, start with our listing of the Best of the best. ", u'These are models that have consistently scored above average in reliability and performed well in our tests when new. ', u'The list of Reliable Used Cars can direct you to models that have been more reliable than the average models of their age, and that meet your budget. ', u'The Used Cars to Avoid list will tell you which models have more problems than the average car of the same age. ', u'For any individual model you are considering, look at its Reliability History chart to see which of the 17 trouble spots may point to potential problem areas. ', u'These scores give an indication of whether other owners have had more or fewer problems than the average model of that age, but cannot tell you anything specific about the individual car you are looking at. ', u'Be sure to check those components particularly carefully before you buy. ', u"What can I expect if I buy a car based on CR's reliability recommendations?I", u'In general, cars have more problems as they age. ', u'A model that has proven reliability is likely to have fewer problems than other models, even as it ages. ', u'But even models with better than average reliability were not necessarily problem free, particularly in older models. ', u'In our 10-year-old models, on average, about 65 percent of owners reported a problem-free year of course that means that 35 percent of owners experienced some kind of problem. ', u'But models that receive better-than-average reliability scores had fewer problems than the average model of the same age. ', u"How does a model's reliability affect whether or not it is recommended by CR?R", u'Reliability is an important factor in our decision whether or not to recommend a model. ', u'In order to earn a CR Recommendation, a model needs to meet three criteria:  ', u'The model needs to do well in our road tests. ', u'The model must have at least average Predicted Reliability. ', u'If the model was crash-tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), it must perform at least adequately. ', u"In addition, pickups and SUVs must not have tipped up in the government's rollover test. ", u'A model that does not earn a Recommendation is not necessarily one we suggest you avoid. ', u"It might fall short of earning a recommendation because we haven't tested it recently. ", u'If CR tested a model, it might not be recommended because it did not score well in our road tests or IIHS and NHTSA safety tests, or because it had below-average predicted reliability. ', u'In those cases, there are often better choices of vehicles for you to consider. ', u'Refer to our Vehicle Ratings comparison for vehicles that scored well overall and are recommended. ', u'How can a car be recommended one year but not the next?O', u'Our subscribers tell us about their experiences each year. ', u'In each Annual Questionnaire, we ask subscribers to ConsumerReports.org and Consumer Reports magazine about problems that they had experienced in the preceding 12 months. ', u'As their reports change from one year to the next, our Predicted Reliability scores sometimes change as well. ', u'Some cars develop more problems as they age. ', u'As manufacturers make both major redesigns and minor changes to their models, the reliability of those models may change. ', u'We have seen that when a model is redesigned, it often experiences more problems in its first year following the redesign. ', u'Often, the reliability picture improves for those models in subsequent years, as the manufacturer works out the design and manufacturing "bugs." In fact, the last year before a major redesign might have the best reliability of a model\'s life cycle. ', u'In some cases, a model is sufficiently redesigned that we cannot use our road test results or our Predicted Reliability data from the previous generation of that model to decide on a recommendation. ', u'Once we have the opportunity to road-test the new model it may earn a Recommendation once again, if all the criteria for CR Recommendation are satisfied. ', u"How Accurate Is CR's Reliability Information?I", u'Is this a scientific survey?T', u'There are generally two criteria that social scientists use to evaluate the quality of a survey: its validity and its reliability. ', u'Validity refers to whether the survey actually measures what it says it does. ', u'Reliability refers to whether the information generated by the survey would be repeated if the survey were to be conducted again. ', u'We have strong evidence that our survey is both valid and reliable. ', u"The questions in the survey are designed professionally by experts in CR's National Research Center, in consultation with our automotive engineers and statisticians. ", u'Members of our survey team have more than 30 years of experience in conducting all sorts of consumer surveys. ', u'The survey uses an aided response technique that leads respondents through well-defined specific items and gives each respondent the same perspective in answering the questions. ', u'The data we report tracks well with other sources of repair and reliability information available on the market. ', u'Although we know that auto manufacturers pay close attention to our reports, they have not formally disputed our survey findings, which often identify problems that the manufacturers see in the warranty experience of their vehicles. ', u"From year to year, our subscribers' reports of their problem experiences are fairly consistent; when there is a difference on a particular model, we can often attribute it to known issues with a particular component of a car. ", u'Is the survey based on a representative sample?A', u'A sample is considered to be representative of a population if the relevant characteristics of the population are reflected in the sample. ', u'So, considering the population of interest is critical in evaluating the quality of a sample. ', u'Our survey sample is drawn from the population of subscribers to ConsumerReports.org and to Consumer Reports magazine. ', u'While all subscribers are invited to participate in the survey, participation is voluntary, and there is always the possibility that those who respond are unique in some particular way. ', u'For example, subscribers have sometimes questioned whether those who respond are those who have a complaint to make about their cars. ', u'To address this concern, we had conducted a validation test in past years. ', u'A representative sample of 8,000 to 10,000 subscribers were mailed the same questions about problem experiences with their cars at the same time as all subscribers were asked to complete the main survey. ', u'Using a combination of incentives and follow-up mailings, we attained at least a 40 to 50 percent response rate on this validation sample. ', u'The validation sample was known to be representative of the subscriber population; by comparing responses from this sample to responses of the main sample, we could assess whether the main sample is representative of the population overall. ', u'In more than 30 years we have not found any biases on any of the questions on any of the topics. ', u'One reason for this is that our survey is an omnibus survey asking subscribers not only about their cars, but about a dozen other products, about major services they have used (such as insurance, hotels, and health plans), as well as suggestions for CR. ', u'The survey also requests participation in our board of directors election. ', u'Many subscribers return surveys reporting that they had no problems at all with their cars in the past year. ', u'This is true for all makes and models of cars. ', u'So, owners with complaints about their cars are not the only ones who return the survey. ', u'Any survey has some sort of sampling frame that limits the people being surveyed. ', u'We choose our subscribers as our sampling frame. ', u'On average, CR subscribers tend to be more educated and affluent than the general population. ', u'With the growth of Consumer Reports online, a wider demographic range of individuals has been surveyed in recent years. ', u'However, our reliability questions do not ask respondents about their attitudes or opinions about the reliability of their cars, where one might expect different groups of individuals to have different perspectives. ', u'Instead, we ask for factual information about whether specifically defined problems occurred; these types of questions are less sensitive to the nature of the characteristics of the sample itself. ', u'Further, our results track well with other sources of reliability information available on the market, and auto manufacturers have not formally disputed our survey findings, which often correspond to problems that the manufacturers see in the warranty experiences of the population of car owners at large. ', u'Is the survey biased toward Japanese cars?I', u'In our survey of CR subscribers, Japanese vehicles are popular. ', u'Also, many Japanese models have had relatively low rates of problems in our survey. ', u'But the fact that we received responses on more than 300 makes and models from nearly all domestic, European, and Korean manufacturers shows that our subscribers do not exclusively favor Japanese vehicles and that they buy a wide range of vehicles of all makes and models. ', u'Unlike some other magazines or surveys, we do not take advertisements from any outside manufacturer, so we have no vested interests in the outcome of our survey. ', u'We have no agenda other than communicate accurate results of our survey. ', u'We do not consider country of origin in our analyses leading to our reliability ratings. ', u'Some Japanese models in our survey have scored below average in reliability, for example the Acura TLX and Nissan Pathfinder, and some American models for example, the Buick Regal and Ford Expedition have scored well above average. ', u'Those findings provide evidence against pro-Japanese bias on the part of our subscribers. ', u"European luxury brandshave made recent progress in CR's latest surveys. ", u'The Audi Q3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC led with the best predicted reliability scores in the compact luxury SUV segment. ', u'Your survey results do not match with my experience. ', u'Is your survey wrong?T', u'The CR reliability information reflects the problem rate, or percentage of cars that experienced problems, across about 100 car owners. ', u'Even in the most unreliable models, some individual car owners are lucky and experience few or no problems during the 12 months covered by the survey. ', u'For example, in one of the worst models in our recent surveys, about 58 percent of the owners reported problems in at least one trouble area over the previous 12 months; of course, this means that about 42 percent of owners reported no problems. ', u'Your neighbor or friend might be one of those lucky owners. ', u'Of course, the opposite can happen as well even in a model that tends to be quite reliable, there is an occasional "lemon."  ', u'Since the average number of problems is small for most models, is Consumer Reports overemphasizing differences that may not be important?B', u'Beyond statistical significance, we believe these differences are also meaningful to car buyers. ', u'We think that car buyers should expect a new car to be entirely problem-free in its first months or years of service. ', u"While the difference between a  and a  may be small, a pattern of several less-than-perfect trouble spots in a brand new car should be cause for concern and does not bode well for a model's long-term reliability. ", u'We have not yet seen a single model in our survey that is entirely problem-free. ', u'More than that, the Cadillac Escalade, which had the worst new car prediction score in the 2016 survey, is about 30 times more likely to have a problem than the best, the Audi Q3. ', u'Those differences among models are important for car buyers to consider in choosing a car. ', u'We present these scores for trouble spots primarily to allow consumers to compare the relative incidence of problems among models. ', u'While there are no guarantees, you can improve your odds of buying a reliable car if you choose a model that has had a lower rate of problems in the past. ', u'Some people maintain their cars differently from others. ', u'How does this affect the Ratings?T', u'The biggest growing area of concern in late-model cars is the in-car electronics: infotainment, entertainment, communication, and navigation systems. ', u'Other problem areas include body integrity (squeaks, rattles, and leaks), and  power equipment (body control module, gauges, and  warning lights). ', u'Maintenance does not affect those items. ', u'Problems in those areas might more likely reflect the inherent design or quality. ', u'How do you account for mileage differences?V', u'Vehicles with higher mileage will most likely experience more problems than vehicles of the same age with lower mileage. ', u'We adjust our analyses to minimize differences among models due to varying mileage. ', u'Our data are mileage-standardized by dividing cars of each model into groups of high, average, and low mileage, and employing the statistical technique of direct standardization. ', u'How do you know that manufacturers don\'t "stuff the ballot box?"In most other surveys that draw their samples from lists of registered car owners, the researcher can control who is mailed a survey. ', u'In the Consumer Reports survey, buying a subscription to either the magazine or to ConsumerReports.org allows you to report on your experience with two cars. ', u'Some subscribers have wondered whether a manufacturer could just arrange to have their employees fill out questionnaires saying that their cars are reliable, as a way to influence our Ratings. ', u'Hypothetically, this is a potential weakness in our survey. ', u'However, there are a number of ways that we can protect against this potential for fraud. ', u'For obvious reasons, we do not want to describe in detail the actions we take in this regard. ', u'We are confident that no manufacturer has succeeded. ', u'If you state that first-year models are less reliable than later-year models, how can you still recommend some new Japanese models in their first year?I', u'It is true that some newly introduced or redesigned models have more problems than later model years of that design. ', u'This happens even to models from the most reliable manufacturers, such as Toyota/Lexus and Honda/Acura. ', u'But despite the decline in reliability due to the new design, if the new/redesigned model still earned an average predicted reliability, and performed well in our testing and independent crash and rollover tests, we will recommend it. ', u'We will not recommend any model that has below average predicted reliability regardless of how well it performed in our testing. ', u'Has Car Reliability Changed Over Time?A', u'Are cars getting more reliable than they used to be?Y', u'In the past 20 years, the reliability of all vehicles has improved greatly, on average. ', u'Of course, some models have remained quite unreliable, while others have improved quite dramatically. ', u'American models have made the greatest improvements, but they historically have had the most improving to do. ', u'Asian models have improved as well, so the gap between domestic and foreign cars has narrowed, but it still remains.

[u'Consumer Reports thinks the Tesla Model S is reliable enough to recommend, though the brand as a whole needs to make some improvements.

[u'In stump speeches all over the country and in the debates, Trump has specifically mentioned Chicago, where more than 550 people have been killed and thousands others wounded so far this year in gun-related violence. ', u'The Republican presidential nominee has repeatedly likened Chicago to a  war-torn country  and suggested that Democrats, led by Clinton, have done nothing to stem the suffering of residents   primarily African-Americans   in violent, poverty-stricken neighborhoods. ', u'It s like a war zone   African-Americans suffering in our country, where in the inner cities, you have no jobs, horrible education.

', u'The GOP nominee has spoken about Chicago s violence nearly everywhere   including at stops in Florida, Ohio, New Hampshire and Maine last week. ', u'But the one place he hasn t talked about Chicago s violence is in Chicago.

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   "Such a nasty woman."Like many people, 23-year-old Emily DiVito was multitasking while watching last week\'s presidential debate, with a little studying and a little Twitter-surfing. ', u'But when DiVito heard Donald Trump say those four words to Hillary Clinton, she shot up in her seat."', u'"The interruptions were so absurd, but that was particularly biting," she said.W', u'What\'s more, the moment gave DiVito, a former avid supporter of Clinton\'s primary rival Bernie Sanders, a feeling of solidarity with Clinton   a "moment of connectivity," as she put it. ', u'"I was for Bernie, but moments like this make me proud to be affiliated with her, the way she is persevering."That\'s good news for Clinton, who despite her lead in the polls, has struggled to connect with millennial voters.I', u'It also was probably bad news for Trump. ', u'Days after his devastating "grab \'em" remarks emerged and he started facing new allegations of sexual assault, the GOP presidential nominee had another bad week, leading some to wonder whether his popularity with female voters had reached rock bottom.T', u'The candidate who so badly needed to close the gender gap instead saw his "nasty woman" remark   accompanied by a wagging index finger   become a feminist battle cry, a galvanizing moment for Clinton and an exclamation point to a campaign dominated by gender.T', u'To Kathy Spillar, the "nasty woman" comment sounded like "the coffin shutting.\'""I thought, \'That\'s it,\'" said Spillar, executive director of the Feminist Majority Foundation. ', u'"Women voters are going to defeat Trump." The comment, she said, not only "summed up his whole attitude about women," but showed how bitter he was about potentially losing to one."', u'"Losing would be bad enough, but that he has lost to a woman really grates on him," Spillar said. ', u'"That\'s certainly clear. And this just fuels the gender gap."An ABC News poll released Sunday, and conducted in the days following Wednesday\'s debate, gave Clinton a 55 percent-35 percent lead over Trump among women. ', u'Among college-educated white women, the gap was 62 percent to 30 percent. ', u"Likely voters, by a margin of 69 percent to 24 percent, disapproved of Trump's response to questions about his treatment of women. ", u'In a Quinnipiac University poll conducted before that debate, Clinton led Trump among women by 52 percent to 37 percent.A', u'Also, an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll released a few days before the debate showed women favoring Clinton over Trump by 55 percent to 35 percent.T', u'Trump supporter Patti Stites felt the latest Trump remarks were unfortunate, but wouldn\'t sway her choice."', u'"It\'s certainly not nice, it\'s not appropriate, especially in a debate," said Stites, 61, of Northfield, New Jersey.

"Now, people are seeing themselves in Donald Trump\'s words toward Hillary, they\'re seeing themselves in how his surrogates act toward women   and toward Latinos and anyone who is not a straight white man."', u'"The "nasty woman" remark, she said, is a "somewhat predictable and almost laughable apex" of what\'s been going on all year. But, she added, it is totally possible that there might be a new apex to come.Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to highlight her opponent\'s trouble with female voters, saying at one point: "Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger."', u'It\'s a way of men lashing out with power."', u'" "I hope I\'m not like that."']

[u'The Earth permanently passed a global warming threshold last year that alarms climate scientists and has profound consequences for everyone alive today   particularly young people looking forward to the future. ', u'According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), observatories around the world found that in 2015 and 2016, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere crossed the symbolic threshold of 400 parts per million (ppm), and that this is likely to remain the case for the foreseeable future. ', u"SEE ALSO: The Great Barrier Reef isn't dead, despite its viral obituaryThis is the highest level ever seen in all of human history and is 144 percent higher than the pre-industrial average. ", u'Such a high level is also very likely the highest on record going back to between 800,000 and 15 million years ago, based on various studies. ', u'For perspective, scientists have found that previous periods with similar carbon dioxide levels   all of which occurred before modern humans evolved   had far higher global average temperatures and sea levels than today. ', u'In some cases, such periods had global average sea levels of 100 feet higher than today.I', u'Image: Scripps institution of oceanography/mashableMany scientists think that avoiding dangerous climate change will require getting carbon dioxide concentrations down to 350 parts per million, which will require massive emissions cuts and new technologies to push annual emissions into negative numbers.W', u'While the planet was flirting with the 400 ppm mark on a month-to-month basis at some observatories, it had not yet breached the line worldwide for an entire year until 2015, the WMO found in a report released Monday. ', u'The rate at which greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane are accumulating in the air guarantees that growing impacts from climate change, ranging from rising sea levels to hotter heat waves and ocean acidification, will continue to occur and in fact worsen in coming decades. ', u'Image: Climate CentralThis is in part because carbon dioxide can last in the air for thousands of years, which is why environmental advocates and policymakers say we only have one to two decades at most to act before an unsafe amount of climate change is essentially baked into the climate system. ', u'The WMO report found there was a nearly 40 percent increase in the warming effect on our climate (technically known as "radiative forcing") between 1990 and 2015, due to the increase in greenhouse gases in the air.S', u'Scientists at the greenhouse gas monitoring station high atop Mauna Loa in Hawaii have said that carbon dioxide levels will not dip below 400 ppm for many generations, according to a WMO press release on Monday. ', u'The year 2015 ushered in a new era of optimism and climate action with the Paris climate change agreement. ', u'But it will also make history as marking a new era of climate change reality with record high greenhouse gas concentrations,  said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas in a statement. ', u'In fact, last year saw the largest annual spike in greenhouse gas concentrations on record.P', u'Part of this sharp annual uptick is due to the strong 2015-16 El Ni o event, which caused droughts in tropical areas that normally absorb carbon as so-called "sinks." Drier than average weather in such areas, including Indonesia, reduced the ability of tropical forests to suck up as much carbon dioxide as they usually do, and increased the occurrence of forest fires that release carbon dioxide into the air.

[u"San Francisco (AFP) - Apple's quarterly profit slumped on a widely expected drop in iPhone sales, but gains in services offered some optimism on the company's efforts to curb dependence on its smartphone.T", u'The company said Tuesday that profit fell 19 percent to $9 billion in the fiscal quarter ending September 24. ', u'Revenue fell nine percent to $46.9 billion from $51.5 billion a year earlier.T', u"The results were largely in line with market forecasts and showed sales of the iPhone -- Apple's biggest revenue and profit driver -- down five percent from a year ago to 45.5 million units.T", u'The quarterly update only provided limited information on the reception of the newest iPhone models, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, which were released in early September, and was likely to benefit from the woes of rival Samsung, suffering from a massive recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7 phone.A', u'Analysts were expecting declines in iPhone sales with many smartphone markets saturated, a situation that has led Apple to focus on new products like the Apple Watch and services like mobile payments, Apple TV and streaming music.C', u'Chief executive Tim Cook welcomed what he called "our strong September quarter results," saying they "cap a very successful fiscal 2016 for Apple.""We\'re thrilled with the customer response to iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus and Apple Watch Series 2, as well as the incredible momentum of our Services business, where revenue grew 24 percent to set another all-time record," he said in a statement.T', u"The world's largest company by market value closed out its fiscal year ending September 24 with a net profit of $45.7 billion on revenues of $215.6 billion, both figures lower than the prior year.A", u'Apple shares fell 2.7 percent in after-hours trade following the release."', u'"Previously, Apple was able to rely on strong sales of phones, tablets and computers to drive up revenue and profit across all geographies.

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   A massive internet attack that paralyzed Twitter, Netflix and other services is being blamed on a specific kind of malware designed to harness the power of ordinary consumer devices.T', u"The bad news: Using it isn't particularly hard and doesn't require much money. ", u'The malware, known as Mirai, was recently posted online for others to adapt for their own attacks.R', u'Researchers say Mirai exploited security vulnerabilities in thousands of internet-connected devices such as web cameras, then used those devices to attack a major internet firm, resulting in widespread outages. ', u"Researchers say Mirai has been used before, but not on the scale of Friday's attacks.H", u"Here's a look at Mirai and what makes it so destructive.___WHAT HAPPENED?D", u'Dyn Inc., an internet company in Manchester, New Hampshire, said its servers were hit by a distributed denial-of-service attack. ', u"These types of attacks work by overwhelming targeted computers with junk traffic, so legitimate traffic can't get through.J", u'Jason Read, founder of the internet performance monitoring firm CloudHarmony, said his company tracked a half-hour-long disruption early Friday affecting access to many popular sites from the East Coast. ', u'A second attack later in the day spread disruption to the West Coast as well as some users in Europe.___WHAT MADE THIS ATTACK SO NASTY?W', u'While distributed denial-of-service attacks have been around for years, hackers have many more devices they can use to pull off their attacks, thanks to the proliferation of internet-connected cameras, thermostats, lights and more.A', u'And Mirai makes it easy for a would-be attacker to scan the internet for devices to take over and turn into "botnets" for launching coordinated attacks, Chris Carlson of the cybersecurity firm Qualys said.W', u'While botnets have been used as weapons for nearly a decade, they have typically been employed by organized crime groups that targeted websites involved in less-than-savory businesses such as pornography or gambling. ', u'Those sites pay extortion money to make the problem go away quietly, Carlson said."', u'"But when you bring it to Dyn, and a lot of the internet gets shut down, people take notice," Carlson said.___WHAT KINDS OF DEVICES WERE AFFECTED?R', u'Researchers at the cybersecurity firm Flashpoint say very few devices in the U.S. seem to be involved.M', u'Most of the junk traffic heaped on Dyn came from internet-connected cameras and video-recording devices that had components made by an obscure Chinese company. ', u'Those components had little security protection, so devices they went into became easy to exploit.B', u"Because the components were put into a variety of devices that were then packaged and rebranded, it's hard to tell exactly where they ended up. ", u'But Flashpoint researchers Allison Nixon and Zach Wikholm say their research shows that the bulk of them ended up in Vietnam, Brazil, Turkey, Taiwan and China. ___ W', u"WHO'S BEHIND IT? ", u'That remains unclear. ', u"Nixon and Wikholm say it's unlikely that this is a state-sponsored attack. ", u"Because the blueprints, or source code, for Mirai were public, an attack like this wouldn't need a government's resources. ", u"Hacker groups have claimed responsibility through Twitter, but those claims haven't been verified and the pair says it's likely that they're all lying. ", u'"These guys are amateurs and they managed to get this far. That\'s kind of scary," Nixon said. ___ A', u'ARE MORE ATTACKS COMING? ', u'Hacker groups have threatened targets ranging from the Russian government to major corporations and the U.S. presidential election. ', u"But it's unclear if those groups are actually capable, or just making empty threats. ", u'Experts say that whatever the target, more attacks are inevitable in light of the continued growth of connected devices and the lack of security requirements for them. ', u'Therefore, the solution lies in boosting device security at the hardware level. ', u'"At the end of the day, these attacks aren\'t super sophisticated," Carlson says. ', u'"They\'re just a blunt hammer and whoever has the biggest hammer wins." T', u"The Department of Homeland Security said Monday that it's been working on security practices for internet-connected gadgets and will release them in the common weeks. ___ F", u'Follow Bree Fowler at https://twitter.com/APBreeFowler .

", u'Microsoft has refined the formula for the Surface Pro quite carefully by this point: a device that looks like a tablet, but with a built-in kickstand and keyboard cover that makes it work like a laptop.I', u"I wouldn't expect that to change much, but there are rumors that Microsoft is going to make the Pro tablet more oriented towards creative types, and the Book towards traditional users who want more of a laptop experience. ", u'Specifically, a new rotary-style control might be coming, called the "Surface Dial." It would be an add-on accessory to help artists draw strange and wonderful things with their Surface tablets.I', u"It would also help Microsoft keep artists using the Surface tablet, now that it's facing stronger competition from Apple's iPad Pro.A", u"As for the Pro and the Surface Book, some rumors are suggesting that we'll have to wait until spring for updates to the hardware. ", u"Even if we do see changes, it will likely just be a spec bump to Intel's Kaby Lake processors, with better performance and battery life the result.A", u"A Surface rival for the iMacThe exciting new hardware could well be an all-in-one PC, because apparently it's 2007 all over again. ", u'We saw a Surface-branded keyboard make its way through the FCC earlier this month, and other leaks have virtually confirmed that Microsoft is making a Surface-branded keyboard and mouse.A', u"Assuming that it's not throwing a launch event for an exciting new range of accessories, the logical conclusion (again, backed up by rumor) is that Microsoft is launching an all-in-one PC to rival the iMac. ", u"The name being thrown around is Surface Studio, as it's apparently catered towards graphic designers and creative individuals.N", u'New Windows featuresTo go along with the new, pro-creative hardware, we can also expect a lot of the event to focus on changes to Windows software. ', u'In particular, we could see upgrades to the software to accommodate new accessories like the rumored Surface Dial, and other drawing tools from third-party manufacturers.N', u'No software demo would be acceptable these days without some mention of artificial intelligence either. ', u"Apple and Google have both shown off advancements to their AI systems in the past few months, and it's a good guess that Microsoft will have something to say about Cortana.S", u"Some rumors have suggested that we're also going to see a Microsoft-branded home hub/speaker, like the Amazon Echo, but with Cortana inside. ", u"If so, we haven't seen any hardware leaks thus far. ", u"It's also a less obvious move for Microsoft, which has yet to really get into the smart home game. ", u"But with Cortana currently just an under-used speech-to-text function on Windows laptops, it's the kind of semi-desperate move that's definitely possible.H", u'Hololens updatesGoing from the desperate back to the exciting, we could also see some updates from Hololens. ', u"It's been years since Microsoft first unveiled its Hololens augmented reality program, and we still don't have any idea of how it will really be used in the real world. ", u'Oculus Rift, HTC Vive and Playstation VR are all now very much a reality, so some kind of update to Hololens is about due.T', u'Trending right now:']

[u"iPhone sales dropped for a third consecutive quarter from July to September, and Apple's fiscal fourth quarter revenue was off 9 percent from where it was a year's ago. ", u"So why did Apple executives seem so upbeat as they talked about the company's financial performance with Wall Street analysts today (Oct. 25)?B", u'Because early sales of the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus were pretty strong, according to figures released by Apple. ', u"And based on the guidance the company is giving Wall Street, it sounds like Apple's expecting iPhone sales in general   and the iPhone 7 Plus in particular   to pick up as the holiday season approaches.T", u"The timing of Apple's projected rebound in iPhone sales comes as its chief rival Samsung is still reeling from the Note 7 fiasco. ", u'With Samsung recalling its big-screen phone after reports of explosions and trying to re-establish trust with customers that its products are safe, Apple looks like it expects some of those customers to give the iPhone a try.I', u"It also doesn't help that there have been a few reports of Galaxy S7 Edge fires.T", u"The story's in the numbers. ", u'Apple sold 45.5 million iPhones during its fourth quarter ended Sept. 24. ', u"While that was down 5 percent from iPhone sales in the year-ago quarter, it's worth noting that analysts expected Apple to only sell 44.8 million phones. ", u'Apple executives credited the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus for the better-than-expected performance, which is significant since the new iPhones only began shipping a week before the quarter ended.A', u"Apple doesn't break down sales figures by unit, but both CEO Tim Cook and chief financial officer Luca Maestri noted that demand for the new phones far outpaced supply, particularly for the iPhone 7 Plus. ", u'In fact, Cook was reluctant to say whether Apple expects to be able to meet demand by the end of the year. ', u'"The underlying demand looks extremely strong on both [iPhones], but particularly on the iPhone 7 Plus versus our forecast going into the product launch."The real story, though, lies in Apple\'s projected revenue for the current quarter. ', u'Apple told analysts it expects to tally between $76 and $78 billion in sales during the holiday season, which would be on par with the record $75.9 billion it did in the same period last year. ', u"With iPhone sales making up the bulk of Apple's revenue   phones accounted for 60 percent of the company's sales in the just-completed quarter   it's clear Apple expects continued interest in the new iPhones.A", u"Apple executives didn't mention Samsung explicitly, but it doesn't require a big logical leap to see that Apple senses an opportunity with the Note 7 now on the sidelines. ", u"The iPhone 7 Plus boasts dual rear cameras that compare very nicely to best-in-class shooter featured on Samsung's flagship phones. ", u"And while the 1920-by-1080 resolution on the Plus's 5.5-inch display can't measure up to the 5.7-inch Quad HD AMOLED panel on the late, lamented Note 7, it still offers a big-screen alternative to mobile phone users who demand a lot of display real estate.T", u"The challenge for Apple is that it's not the only option for disaffected Samsung customers. ", u"Google's recently released Pixel phones have won rave reviews for their cameras, and the 5.5-inch Pixel XL looks like a formidable Note 7 alternative in its own right. ", u"LG's 5.7-inch V20 smartphone makes its debut later this week as another option for customers ready to leave Samsung in the dust.B", u'But Apple thinks it can win over Android users, in large part because it already has. ', u'"Fiscal 2016 saw more customers switch from Android to iPhone than ever before," Cook said during his briefing with analysts. ', u"Both Apple's ability to keep convincing smartphone users to switch and the iPhone 7 Plus's ability to measure up to rival Android devices will go a long way in deciding who grabs those Note 7 customers looking for a new phone."]

[u'By Joseph MennSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Obama administration officials sought on Monday to reassure the public that it was taking steps to counter new types of cyber attacks such as the one Friday that rendered Twitter, Spotify, Netflix and dozens of other major websites unavailable.T', u'The Department of Homeland Security said it had held a conference call with 18 major communication service providers shortly after the attack began and was working to develop a new set of  strategic principles  for securing internet-connected devices.D', u'DHS said its National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center was working with companies, law enforcement and researchers to cope with attacks made possible by the rapidly expanding number of smart gadgets that make up the "internet of Things."Such devices, including web-connected cameras, appliances and toys, have little in the way of security.

[u"By Andrew Cawthorne and Alexandra UlmerCARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's increasingly militant opposition stepped up its push to oust leftist leader Nicolas Maduro on Wednesday with protests that drew hundreds of thousands but also saw unrest leading to dozens of injuries and arrests.I", u'In an incident sure to inflame the already polarized situation, a policeman died after being shot on Wednesday night in central Miranda state.T', u'The government blamed opposition activists clashing with security forces on a highway out of Caracas.

[u'With a higher probability that Secretary Hillary Clinton will win the White House embedded in the latest polls, analysts say that overall the market is in a stronger position.

', u'And, franchise-oriented companies like McDonald s (MCD) should be more insulated.M', u'Meanwhile Credit Suisse noted that stocks with international exposure including the industrial sector specifically are well-positioned under a Clinton White House.T', u'This is related to fear over the implications of candidate Donald Trump s isolationist views on trade, Calvasina said, which pose a risk to the economy and  challenge the fundamental playbook that equity investors have had in place over the last decade, in which global exposure/sourcing is viewed as a good thing and a driver of growth. ', u'Plus, Clinton like Trump also supports a big push in infrastructure spending, which should provide a boost to machinery names like Eaton (ETN) and Fluor (FLR), multi-industry names like United Technologies (UTX) and Honeywell (HON) along with aerospace and defense names like Boeing (BA).S', u'Sector risksFinancials and health care could be more adversely affected in the short term over fears about increased regulatory pressures under Clinton, according to Credit Suisse.H', u'However, these issues could be short-lived.F', u'For the financials, the passage of the election removes a barrier to Fed rate hikes, where the steepening yield curve is positive for the group.C', u'Credit Suisse specifically said it sees smaller regional banking names as out-sized winners, as they can avoid the issues including heightened regulatory pressures, continued implementation of Dodd-Frank, and heightened scrutiny of consumer practices that the bulge bracket banks must face.O', u'One area that may be more permanently-negative?

[u'By Lisa Rapaport(Reuters Health) - Despite a variety of recent efforts to reduce pharmacy bills for U.S. seniors, many elderly patients with diabetes still face substantial out-of-pocket drug costs and may end up skipping their medications as a result, a recent study suggests.R', u'Researchers focused on drug costs for seniors before and after the 2006 implementation of a prescription benefit known as Medicare Part D that was designed to help reduce out-of-pocket costs. ', u'They found that costs fell slightly across the board, but many seniors still face high drug expenses.O', u'One reason is that roughly two in five Part D enrollees may still hit what s known as a coverage gap, or  donut hole,  where they must start paying the entire cost of medications out-of-pocket. ', u'Before Part D was introduced, three in five enrollees hit the coverage gap.W', u'When out of pocket costs are too high, many seniors simply stop taking their needed medications, the study team notes. ', u'Medicare Part D beneficiaries with diabetes are vulnerable to nonadherence to their medications when they enter the coverage gap period because they cannot afford the full cost of medications which may impose risks to their health, said lead author Yoon Jeong Choi of Seoul National University College of Nursing in South Korea. ', u'The majority of medications used to treat diabetes are not available in generic formulation,  Choi added by email. ', u'For this reason, they are more expensive and generally require higher copayment even when patients have prescription drug coverage. ', u'To assess changes over time in seniors  out-of-pocket costs for diabetes drugs, researchers examined data on 4,664 adults 65 or older with Medicare coverage as well as 2,938 younger adults aged 50 to 60 with other types of insurance.A', u'All of the patients in the study had diabetes and researchers followed the participants from 2000 to 2011.F', u'From 2000 to 2005, Medicare enrollees in the study had average out-of-pocket prescription drug costs of about $1,590 a year.O', u'Over the next six years, Medicare enrollees who signed up for Medicare Part D drug benefits had their average annual out-of-pocket costs for drugs drop to about $953 a year, while Medicare members without Part D plans had average annual costs of roughly $1,016.T', u'The younger diabetics not on Medicare in the comparison group had average out-of-pocket costs of about $1,036 during the first six years of the study, then saw this drop to around $938 from 2006 to 2011.R', u'Researchers say it s unclear why prescription costs dropped for everyone in the post-Part D period. ', u'They note that before Part D, all the Medicare beneficiaries had prescription spending almost 11 percent higher than the younger group, and afterwards it was about the same as the younger group, though for people on Part D it was 5.3 percent lower.O', u'One limitation of the study is that it s impossible to determine whether patients in Medicare Part D plans had lower out-of-pocket costs because of this coverage or because people with steeper bills chose to sign up for different insurance, the authors note.I', u'In addition, the younger group in the study excluded people who received Medicare due to a disability or a diagnosis of advanced kidney disease, which may have excluded some diabetics with the highest drug costs for this age group, the researchers explain.E', u'Even so, the findings suggest at least some Medicare patients, including those with Part D, may still struggle with drug costs, said Julie Schmittdiel, director of Kaiser Permanente s Health Delivery Systems Center for Diabetes Translational Research in Oakland, California. ', u'High out of pocket expenses for diabetes medications can negatively impact patients  ability to regularly fill and take their medications,  Schmittdiel, who wasn t involved in the study, said by email. ', u"This 'cost-related non-adherence' can lead to poorly controlled blood sugar levels and blood pressure levels that contribute to diabetes complications,  she said. ", u"This study helps demonstrate that the Medicare Part D program reduces out of pocket drug expenses for diabetes patients, while also showing that the risk of incurring high out of pocket expenses and falling into the Part D coverage 'gap' remains high for these patients,  Schmittdiel added.S", u'SOURCE: http://bit.ly/2fmuSGJ Diabetes Care, online November 1, 2016.']

[u"SIERRA MADRE MOUNTAINS, Philippines (AP)   Communist guerrillas warned that a peace deal with President Rodrigo Duterte's government is unlikely to be reached if he won't end the Philippines' treaty alliance with the United States and resist foreign control by other countries he's trying to befriend, like China and Russia.I", u"In a clandestine news conference in a New People's Army guerrilla encampment tucked in the harsh wilderness of the Sierra Madre mountains southeast of Manila, regional rebel commander and spokesman Jaime Padilla outlined the advantages and downside of talking with Duterte to end one of the world's longest-running Marxist insurgencies.T", u'The dozens of mostly young guerrillas in muddy boots in their rain-soaked encampment on a wooded plateau reflected their resiliency but also showed the tough conditions that have long hampered their insurgency. ', u'Young rebels cooked rice, pork and chicken in soot-covered pots over wood fire while others gingerly puffed cigarettes while watching the peripheries. ', u'The nearest army camp lies just 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) away. ', u'When an air force Huey helicopter flew overhead, rebels at the news conference briefly paused and watched the passing aircraft.F', u"Founded in 1968, the rebels' communist party has held peace talks with six Philippine presidents, including Duterte, whose rise to power in June sparked rebel optimism due to his searing anti-U.S", u'S. rhetoric, populist pro-poor stance and appointments of at least two left-wing Cabinet members.B', u"But the guerrillas have also found themselves in a dilemma due to Duterte's moves they find reprehensible, including the killings of large number of poor drug users that sparked accusations of massive human rights violations against him, a recent decision to allow dictator Ferdinand Marcos to be buried in a heroes' cemetery and threats to shift to dictatorial rule if rival politicians derail his anti-drug crackdown and try to impeach him.W", u'While the president has gotten attention with his angry threats to end the presence of American forces in the country, stop joint combat exercises with U.S. troops and terminate a defense accord with Washington, Padilla said Duterte has, so far, not formalized these utterances and instead has walked back on many publicly-stated policies."', u'"While the Duterte government hasn\'t abrogated all these treaties, the New People\'s Army will have no reason to enter into a friendship or alliance with him," Padilla, 69, told a small group of journalists escorted into an encampment ringed by mostly young rifle-wielding guerrillas."', u'"That\'s not negotiable because as long as the U.S. military has a presence, the imperialist influence on Duterte\'s government will remain," said the bespectacled Padilla, who wore a Mao cap with his 9mm pistol within reach on a wooden table.O', u"Other rebels echoed Padilla's remarks. ", u'"We support Duterte but not 100 percent," said a 24-year-old rebel who identified himself as Guiller. ', u'"He\'s projecting himself as anti-U.S. and pro-poor but that\'s still mostly rhetoric. If the problems persist, the revolution will go on."Duterte\'s reaching out to China and Russia also disturbs the communists. ', u'"They hide behind what we call a communist (facade) or socialism but essentially, and in their core, they are imperialist nations, which control parts of the world," Padilla said. ', u'"Even if it\'s China that controls us, we\'re not free, and we should fight their control on us."Coinciding with the rebel warning, the Philippine armed forces chief, Gen. Ricardo Visaya announced Wednesday that most joint exercises with the U.S. military would proceed next year, including the largescale Balikatan maneuvers. ', u'Most would be refocused, though, on disaster-response, humanitarian missions and counterterrorism from previous maneuvers centered on territorial defense that Duterte worries may offend China.V', u"Visaya's statement came after he met U.S. ", u'Pacific Command in an annual defense meeting on Tuesday.D', u"Despite thorny issues, Padilla said Maoist guerrillas remain committed to pursue talks with Duterte while criticizing his wrong moves, like allowing Marcos's heroes' burial and carrying out the bloody anti-drugs crackdown.P"]

[u"By Ransdell Pierson(Reuters) - The failure of Eli Lilly and Co's Alzheimer's treatment to slow declines in mental capacity of patients with even mild symptoms cast serious doubt over whether a long-held approach to the memory-robbing disease could provide meaningful benefit to millions of people at risk.M", u"Many investors and families had been counting on solanezumab to become the first approved medicine to slow progression of the disease, which the Alzheimer's Association estimates will strike as many as 28 million Americans by midcentury.B", u'But its third and latest failure in a large Phase III trial, this time in patients seen as more likely to be helped, could turn researcher and investor focus beyond drugs that directly target beta amyloid protein in the blood and brain, long thought to be an underlying cause of Alzheimer\'s."', u'"This will increase the interest in tau-lowering drugs for sure," said Dr. Sam Gandy, director of Mount Sinai School of Medicine Center for Cognitive Health, referring to a different protein being targeted in earlier-stage research, including by Lilly, Johnson & Johnson and others.L', u'Lilly shares fell 10.5 percent after the U.S. drugmaker on Wednesday announced long-awaited results of its Expedition 3 study, showing patients treated with solanezumab did not experience a significantly greater slowing in cognitive decline than those given placebos.T', u'The news caused a 3.8 percent drop in shares of Biogen Inc, whose aducanumab also targets beta amyloid believed to cause toxic brain plaques.

[u'TOKYO (Reuters) - Toyota Motor Corp said it aims to develop a more advanced electric-car battery "in a few years" that will allow the Japanese automaker to build vehicles with up to 15 percent greater range and battery life than they have currently.

[u'NEW YORK (AP) -- Shoppers were on the hunt for deals and were at the stores for entertainment Friday as malls opened for what is still one of the busiest days of the year, even as the start of the holiday season edges ever earlier. ', u"Julie Singewald's Black Friday started at 4 a.m. at a Twin Cities outlet mall. ", u'By 6 a.m., she and her two teenage daughters made it to the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota.

Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, used to launch the holiday season, but the competition to grab customers first is keen. ', u"Stores like Macy's, Walmart, Target and more were open Thursday evening in what they hope will be a new holiday tradition as they try to fight off competition from online juggernaut Amazon. ", u'After what appeared to be a strong turnout for Thanksgiving sales, some early morning reports indicate that traffic to malls may be slower on Black Friday than last year as retailers spread the deals out throughout the week. ', u'"It was a really good start. But I have never seen Black Friday morning so calm," said Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst at NPD Group, a market research firm, who visited malls on Long Island on Friday. ', u"He still believes the weekend's sales will likely be up over last year because shoppers did lots of buying, including pricey flat-screen TVs.

', u'Sam Glynn said it\'s at local shops where they will look for "cool knives and glassware, things that have meaning."  ', u'Wal-Mart Stores Inc., which started its Black Friday sales on Thursday at 6 p.m., said shoppers were embracing technology products.

", u'Wal-Mart started its online sale just after midnight on Thanksgiving, three hours earlier than last year. ', u'It reported on Friday that 70 percent of the traffic to its website came from mobile devices. ', u'Leah Olson was at Mall of America Friday morning, following some Thanksgiving night trips to Target and a local mall.

[u"By Susan HeaveyWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Wisconsin's election board agreed on Friday to conduct a statewide recount of votes cast in the presidential race, as requested by a Green Party candidate seeking similar reviews in two other states where Donald Trump scored narrow wins.T", u"The recount process, including an examination by hand of the nearly 3 million ballots tabulated in Wisconsin, is expected to begin late next week after Green Party candidate Jill Stein's campaign has paid the required fee, the Elections Commission said.T", u"The state faces a Dec. 13 federal deadline to complete the recount, which may require canvassers in Wisconsin's 72 counties to work evenings and weekends to finish the job in time, according to the commission.T", u'The recount fee has yet to be determined, the agency said in a statement on its website.

', u'They also cited "unexplained high numbers of undervotes," the close finish between the two nominees and "discrepancies between pre-election polling and the official result," she said.A', u'According to Stein, the Wisconsin commission confirmed receipt of her recount petition at 3:45 p.m. local time, just over an hour before the deadline for filing. ', u'The filing deadline is Monday in Pennsylvania and Wednesday in Michigan.T', u'The Wisconsin board said Stein was joined in her petition by another third-party candidate, Rocky Roque De La Fuente.A', u'Although Trump won narrowly in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the margins make it highly unlikely any recounts would end up giving Clinton a win in all three states, which would be needed for the overall election result to change. ', u'Trump beat Clinton in Pennsylvania by 70,010 votes, in Michigan by 10,704 votes and in Wisconsin by 27,257 votes.T', u'The presidential race is decided by the Electoral College, based on a tally of wins from the state-by-state contests, rather than by the popular national vote. ', u'The Electoral College results are expected to be finalized on Dec. 19.T', u"Trump surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win, although Clinton will have won the national popular vote by more than 2 million ballots once final tallies are in.A representative for Trump's transition team on Thursday had no comment on Stein's effort, and Clinton has not commented on Stein's effort.(Additional reporting by Gina Cherelus, Brendan O'Brien and Frank McGurty in New York and Eric Walsh in Washington; Writing by Steve Gorman; Editing by Simon Cameron-Moore)"]

[u"JERUSALEM (AP)   Israeli firefighters on Friday reined in a blaze that had spread across the country's third-largest city of Haifa and forced tens of thousands of people to flee their homes, but continued to battle more than a dozen other fires around the country for the fourth day in a row.T", u'The over 60,000 Israelis evacuated began returning to their charred homes to assess the damage as police and firefighting units remained heavily deployed in the Haifa area for fear that the fires could be reignited due to the dry, windy weather.T', u'Though no deaths or serious injuries have been reported, several dozen people have been hospitalized for smoke inhalation. ', u'Hundreds of homes were damaged and in a rare move, Israel called up military reservists to join overstretched police and firefighters and made use of an international fleet of firefighting aircraft sent by several countries.A', u"A Boeing 747-400 Supertanker, the world's largest fire-fighting aircraft capable of carrying 75 tons of fire retardant, is scheduled to arrive later Friday to help the efforts, though officials said it may not be needed by then.P", u'Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said a small village in the forests near Jerusalem was evacuated overnight as several homes there caught fire.

[u"By Alexandra UlmerCARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's ruling socialists mourned former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, while opposition hard-liners exulted over the death of a man they called a dictator who helped wreck their economy and whose country for years had an easy ride with subsidized oil.T", u'The two leftist Latin American governments became intimate allies under Castro and his younger disciple, the late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, a relationship buttressed by generous oil shipments from the OPEC country to the Communist-run island in return for thousands of Cuban doctors, teachers, sports trainers and security advisers.B', u'But that economic lifeline to Cuba ebbed in recent years as Venezuela, in the throes of a brutal economic crisis that has seen millions skipping meals, has cut back on the subsidized crude.V', u'Venezuela used to send Cuba some 100,000 barrels of oil per day, but data seen by Reuters showed a 40 percent decline in crude shipments in the first half of the year compared with 2015 and that could fall further amid a production slump.A', u'After Chavez died of cancer in 2013 following treatment in Cuba, the special personal relationship between the two governments cooled, too.C', u"Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, and Raul Castro, who took over from his older brother in 2008, do not have as strong a connection.I", u'Indeed, Maduro seemed caught out when Raul Castro, considered a pragmatist, announced he was seeking to mend ties with their shared "imperialist" enemy, the United States, in 2014.S', u'Still, there are no public signs of fissures, and Maduro on Saturday hailed the leader whom the Latin American left has held up as one of the ultimate political icons."', u'"Fidel was a human being beyond what is normal, we all know that. He was and will remain a living legend," said an emotional Maduro during a ceremony at a hillside military museum which houses Chavez\'s remains."', u'"A sepulchral chill of sadness and pain blew in when we learned the news of Fidel\'s departure," added Maduro, as Socialist Party officials, the Cuban ambassador, and supporters wiped away tears, waved flags, and sang traditional Cuban songs including "Guantanamera."Venezuela decreed three days of public mourning, canceled a music festival in Caracas, and state television dedicated a special program to Castro, publicized with the slogan "Honor and Glory to Fidel."NEW ERA?B', u"But many in Venezuela's opposition rejoiced over the passing of 90-year-old Fidel Castro at a time when South America is shifting right after a decade of a strong leftist bloc buoyed by a commodities boom.T", u'The opposition itself is seeking to remove unpopular Maduro via a recall referendum and, although authorities have quashed the vote, some activists saw Castro\'s death as an auspicious sign."', u'"We\'re definitely in a change of era, dictatorship is dying," tweeted opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido.O', u"Opposition activists say that while Chavez and Castro may have set out with good intentions to fight the region's deep economic inequalities and elite politicians, they turned into tyrants.H", u'Hard-line Venezuelans are convinced Havana sends orders to Caracas and bemoan rampant food and medicine shortages they say have turned their country into "Cubazuela."In what has become Cuba\'s flagship presence in Venezuela, thousands of doctors work in neglected Venezuelan communities, where they are widely praised by low-income patients, although they have become hate figures for the opposition, who see them as modern-day slaves providing low-quality care. ', u'Some have fled from Venezuela to the United States, via Colombia. ', u"Venezuela's hyperactive social media scene was filled with tongue-in-cheek memes, including one showing Chavez and Fidel Castro reunited in hell. ", u"The Venezuelan opposition slammed the government's ode to Castro amid the economic crisis and raging violent crime. ", u'"When Maduro\'s drug-trafficking and corrupt government leaves, we\'ll celebrate for a year! Mourn for Castro? Mourn for the thousands of Venezuelans killed!" said opposition leader Henrique Capriles. (Aditional reporting by Eyanir Chinea; Editing by Andrew Cawthorne, Jonathan Oatis and Andrew Hay)']

[u"Bras lia (AFP) - Brazil's President Michel Temer, together with congressional leaders, vowed on Sunday to block any attempt by legislators to grant themselves a corruption amnesty as he sought to defuse a series of scandals.I", u'In a rare weekend news conference, the president sought to reassure Brazilians that he is fighting corruption among the political elite and working to restore an economy that he predicted will see an upturn in the second quarter of 2017.T', u'Temer -- a center-right veteran politician who took power after the bruising impeachment of his leftist predecessor Dilma Rousseff -- has stated his mission is to save Brazil from its worst recession and corruption scandal in decades.H', u"However, the country's would-be savior is now beset by controversy himself just as the Senate prepares to vote Tuesday on a 20-year spending freeze that would be the first of several deep reforms billed as measures to restore the economy's health.S", u'Seated alongside the speakers of the Senate and lower house of Congress, Temer said he would veto any attempt by the legislature to grant itself an amnesty on undeclared campaign donations."', u'"It would be impossible for the president of the republic to approve something of this nature," he said. ', u'"We all agreed there isn\'t the slightest basis... for going ahead with this proposal."He was responding to public outrage over an attempt in the lower house on Thursday to vote on a bill apparently including an amnesty for the previous acceptance of undeclared funds -- often suspected to be bribes -- in political campaigns.T', u'Temer, who took office vowing to end the paralysis and infighting of the Rousseff presidency, was also forced to respond to the latest crisis within his own cabinet.I', u'It involves a powerful minister, government secretary Geddel Vieira Lima, who forced to resign on Friday after the former culture minister accused him of pressuring him to intervene in a business deal. ', u'The ministerial resignation was the sixth since Temer took over in May.T', u'The former culture minister has claimed that Temer also pressured him over the business deal and that he had secretly recorded the president, according to local media reports.T', u'Temer said he had never misused his influence and blasted the use of secret recordings."', u'"For a minister to record the president of the republic is extremely serious," Temer said.- Storm on the horizon -The televised show of unity between Temer and the two congressional leaders suggested the president retains enough political capital for now to proceed with his economic reforms.H', u'He promised recession-weary Brazilians that they would notice positive changes."', u'"We\'re not standing still, we\'re working to build growth, and this will come little by little," he said, predicting "results" in the second quarter."', u'"We will propose reforms so that Brazil can exit the recession," he added. ', u'"We will boost industry, business and agribusiness."But the 20-year spending ceiling -- to be followed by proposed cuts to social security, pensions and other politically sensitive areas -- has already prompted fury in some quarters.I', u'In downtown Sao Paulo, thousands of people gathered Sunday for a rally that organizers said attracted 40,000 demonstrators, although police did not provide any official figures. ', u'Meanwhile, Temer and the elite in Brasilia face a potentially devastating new storm on the corruption front. ', u'Numerous members of Congress and political parties have already been linked to the alleged receipt of bribe money and campaign slush funds as part of the giant Petrobras state oil company embezzlement scandal. ', u'That could soon expand with accusations stemming from a mass plea bargain struck with dozens of executives at the construction giant Odebrecht, the company at the core of the Petrobras scheme. ', u'Odebrecht systematically bribed politicians and parties, partly to win inflated contracts with Petrobras. ', u'Now, Brazilian media reports indicate that the executives may name as many as 150 politicians in the plea bargains struck with investigating prosecutors. ', u'Temer said it would be "naive" not to be worried about the coming revelations. ', u'"When you\'re talking about... 150 people from the political class, of course there\'s concern, in an institutional sense."']

[u'Apple s iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus are the best-selling smartphones in the world by a significant margin, regardless of whether or not sales are measuring up to analysts  guesstimates. ', u'Apple s manufacturing partners still haven t even come close to building enough iPhone 7 Plus supply to meet demand, and the smaller iPhone 7 is thought to be selling quite quickly as well. ', u'Strong iPhone 7 and 7 Plus sales are even more impressive when you consider the fact that Apple reused the same hardware design for a third consecutive year in 2016   people still want to upgrade to these powerful new iPhones even though they look almost identical to iPhones released all the way back in 2014.N', u'Now, imagine what demand will be like if Apple releases a completely redesigned iPhone 8 with a new curved OLED display.T', u'The Wall Street Journal published a lengthy report on Monday morning suggesting that Apple might launch a new iPhone in 2017 with a curved OLED display. ', u'Unfortunately, there aren t many firm details in the report, despite its length.A', u'A few claims stand out. ', u'First, WSJ says that Apple is currently testing more than 10 different prototypes for next year s new iPhone 8, and it has not yet decided which new design will be featured on the final version of the phone. ', u'According to the paper s sources, at least one of the 10+ prototypes in testing features a curved OLED display, but it s not clear if that is the version of the iPhone 8 that will debut next year.A', u'Apple has supposedly asked its suppliers to increase OLED output, and it has also requested prototypes of OLED screens that feature  better resolution than ones from Samsung,  in an effort to  differentiate its models. ', u'This claim sounds dubious at best.S', u'Samsung s current OLED panels feature 2K resolution. ', u'It s entirely possible that Apple is testing higher-resolution screens for its next iPhones, but there is no chance that the motivation behind upping the resolution of its displays has anything to do with Samsung or its phones. ', u'Apple has stayed with comparatively low-resolution displays on its recent iPhones   720p on the iPhone 7, 1080p on the iPhone 7 Plus   because on displays of this size, pixel count doesn t have a huge impact on image quality once you hit a certain threshold. ', u'If Apple is toying with 4K displays, interest surrounding virtual reality applications would be a far more likely explanation.W', u'WSJ also reiterated an earlier report from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, suggesting that the OLED iPhone 8 will be just one of several new iPhone models that will be released in 2017.

[u'On November 27, 1973, the United States Senate became the first legislative house to act under the 25th Amendment, when it voted to approve Representative Gerald Ford as the new Vice President. ', u'A week later, the House also approved Ford, making his appointment official.P', u'President Nixon and Vice Presidential nominee FordWhile it may seem obvious today that a new Vice President should be appointed to fill that office in case of a death, disability, resignation or impeachment, that wasn t the case until 1967.T', u'The 25th Amendment was ratified by the states on February 10, 1967 and it cleared up a lot of issues about presidential and vice presidential succession that were unresolved (or unanticipated) by the Founding Fathers.I', u'It was up to Vice President John Tyler, who found himself in an awkward position after President William Henry Harrison s death in 1841, to set the precedent for presidential succession that lasted until 1967. ', u'In Article II, Section 1, the Constitution said that,  In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President. ', u'After Harrison s death, there was confusion about Tyler s status as Acting President or as the actual President, in title as well as function. ', u'Tyler boldly declared himself as President for the remainder of Harrison s term and Congress recognized his title. ', u'The precedent held after the deaths of six Presidents in office   Taylor, Lincoln, Garfield, McKinley, Harding and Franklin Roosevelt. ', u'But after President Dwight Eisenhower had health problems, a congressional effort started to clear up presidential succession questions. ', u'President John F. Kennedy s assassination in November 1963 made the process imperative.I', u'In the case of a vice presidential vacancy before 1967, the office remained empty until the next general election. ', u'In fact, before 1967, the office of Vice President was vacant 16 times due to deaths, resignations and assumptions of the President s office.T', u'The 25th Amendment s first use came in October 1973, when President Richard Nixon nominated Gerald Ford to replace Spiro Agnew just two days after Agnew s resignation as Vice President.P', u'Part of the push to get Ford approved was related to an expanded constitutional role granted to the Vice President under the 25th Amendment in cases where the President was unable to serve temporarily or permanently. ', u'The 25th Amendment made it very clear that the Vice President becomes President in the case of death, resignation and removal from office. ', u'It also said that a President can nominate someone to become Vice President if that office is vacant, with the approval of Congress.S', u'Section 3 and 4 established new roles for the Vice President if the President were unable to perform his or her official duties. ', u'Certainly, one potential constitutional crisis would be the lack of a Vice President in office to start a Section 4 disability review of a President. ', u'Another is the lack of a constitutional or legal precedent for someone to act as a temporary Vice President, to start the Section 4 review process.I', u'In October 1973, at least some of those options seemed in play as the Watergate Scandal was in full play and President Nixon s future was in doubt.N', u'Nixon considered four replacements for Agnew: Ford, Rockefeller, John Connolly and Ronald Reagan. ', u'Nixon preferred Connolly, but when his staff informally polled congressional Democrats, Ford was their choice.I', u'In House and Senate hearings, the situation was tense as times since the Saturday Night Massacre happened during the Ford nomination process. ', u'But on November 27, the Democrat-controlled Senate voted 92 to 3 to confirm Ford, all but confirming his appointment. ', u'On December 6, the House agreed, in a 387 to 35 vote.F', u'Ford then took his oath in the House chamber, leading Nixon aide Alexander Haig to comment on the seriousness of the occasion. ', u'Ford was treated throughout the ceremony and afterwards as a President-in-waiting, especially by Republicans, and there can be little question that Richard Nixon s presidency was over, in their minds, from the moment his successor took the oath,  Haig said.A', u'As a historical footnote, if the 25th Amendment had not been in place, House Speaker Carl Albert, a Democrat, would have replaced Nixon as acting President in August 1974.']

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   You might have thought about it, heard it. ', u'You might have even felt it: Dictionary.com\'s word of the year is "xenophobia."While it\'s difficult to get at exactly why people look up words in dictionaries, online or on paper, it\'s clear that in contentious 2016, fear of "otherness" bruised the collective consciousness around the globe.T', u"The Brexit vote, police violence against people of color, Syria's refugee crisis, transsexual rights and the U.S. presidential race were among prominent developments that drove debate   and spikes in lookups of the word, said Jane Solomon, one of the dictionary site's lexicographers.T", u'The 21-year-old site defines xenophobia as "fear or hatred of foreigners, people from different cultures, or strangers." And it plans to expand its entry to include fear or dislike of "customs, dress and cultures of people with backgrounds different from our own," Solomon said in a recent interview.T', u"The word didn't enter the English language until the late 1800s, she said. ", u'Its roots are in two Greek words   "xenos," meaning "stranger or guest," and "phobos," meaning "fear or panic," Solomon added.T', u'The interest was clear June 24, within a period that represents the largest spike in lookups of xenophobia so far this year.

', u'"But after the EU referendum, hundreds and hundreds of users were looking up the term every hour."Robert Reich, who served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and was President Clinton\'s labor secretary, felt so strongly about xenophobia\'s prominence today that he appears in a video for Dictionary.com discussing its ramifications."', u'"I don\'t think most people even know what xenophobia is," Reich, who teaches public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview.

[u"HAVANA (AP)   Thousands of Cubans began lining up early near Havana's Plaza of the Revolution Monday carrying portraits of Fidel Castro, flowers and Cuban flags for the start of week-long services bidding farewell to the man who ruled the country for nearly half a century.O", u'One of the first in line was Tania Jimenez, 53, a mathematician who arrived at 4 a.m. carrying a rose."', u'"Fidel is everything to us, the soul of this country who gave everything, all his life," Jimenez said in tears.A', u'A nine-story image of a young Castro joined the towering images of fallen guerrillas overlooking the massive square where the government said Cubans would "render homage and sign a solemn oath to carry out the concept of the revolutionary expressed by the revolutionary leader."After 10 years of leadership by Castro\'s younger brother Raul, a relatively camera-shy and low-key successor, Cuba finds itself riveted once again by the words and images of the leader who dominated the lives of generations. ', u'Since his death on Friday night, state-run newspapers, television and radio have been running wall-to-wall tributes to Fidel, broadcasting non-stop footage of his speeches, interviews and foreign trips, interspersed with adulatory remembrances by prominent Cubans."', u'"There\'s a genuine feeling of mourning, that\'s not a formality, that\'s not showy, that\'s not outward-focused, but rather completely intimate," former National Assembly President Ricardo Alarcon said on state television Sunday.O', u'Ordinary people have largely been staying at home, off streets hushed by a prohibition on music and celebration during the nine days of official mourning for Castro. ', u"For some, particularly younger Cubans, Castro's death barely registered.Y", u"Yankemell Barrera, a 20-year-old student, said Castro wasn't a strong presence in his life and that he wasn't much affected by his death or planning to go to any of the memorial events. ", u'He said studying for finals would be a better use of his time."', u'"Even if I\'m obligated to go, I\'m not doing it," he said.T', u'Tens of thousands of others, though, were expected to return to the streets Monday after 9 a.m., when simultaneous 21-gun salutes will sound in the capital and in the eastern city of Santiago, where Castro launched his revolution in 1953. ', u'At the same moment, Cubans are expected to begin filing through the monument to national hero Jose Marti in the center of the plaza, where they were expected to sign the "concept of the revolution" oath.T', u'The "concept of revolution" is a section of a 2000 speech in which Castro calls Cubans to believe in "the profound conviction that no force in the world is capable of crushing the force of truth and ideas."The government did not say if the ashes of the 90-year-old former president would be on display inside the monument. ', u'Virtually all schools and government offices were closing during the homage to Castro, which will stretch for 13 hours on Monday and take place again on Tuesday, ending in a rally echoing those that Castro addressed on the plaza for most of his time in power."', u'"It\'s a terrible sadness. Everyone\'s feeling it here," said Orlando Alvarez, a 55-year-old jeweler. ', u'"Everyone will be there."On Wednesday, Castro\'s ashes will begin a three-day procession east across Cuba, retracing the march of his bearded rebel army from the Sierra Maestra mountains to the capital.

[u'The Hague (AFP) - Dutch officials have culled 190,000 ducks on a central Netherlands farm where inspectors have confirmed the presence of a highly infectuous strain of bird flu, officials and local media said Sunday.T', u'The outbreak was detected at a farm in Biddinghuizen, about 70 kilometres (43 miles) west of Amsterdam, where about 180,000 ducks were put down together with another 10,000 within a one kilometre radius, the Dutch food and safety watchdog NVWA said."', u'"There are three other poultry farms within a three kilometre radius and they are being monitored," the NVWA added in a statement.A', u'Authorities have also imposed a ban on poultry and poultry product transport within a 10 kilometre radius, the statement said.T', u'Tests indicated that the birds were killed by an H5N8 variant of the disease "which is highly infectuous" for poultry -- killing about 30 percent of infected birds -- but not "very dangerous to humans", public newscaster NOS said.E', u'Earlier this month the Netherlands shuttered petting zoos and banned duck hunting as it stepped up measures to stem a bird flu outbreak blamed for killing scores of poultry and more than a thousand wild birds in the country.I', u'In the western port of Rotterdam, a park closed its animal section after several aquatic birds were found to have died from the H5N8 virus.

[u'Geneva (AFP) - Subsidies given by the US state of Washington to Boeing are illegal, the World Trade Organization said Monday, in a victory for rival aircraft maker Airbus and the European Union.T', u"The ruling from a WTO panel is the latest blow in a drawn out trans-Atlantic battle between the aviation industry's two titans, which has seen both Airbus and Boeing score points along the way.T", u'The WTO said that subsidies set up by Washington state to support production of Boeing\'s 777X jet were "prohibited" as they encouraged the use of domestic materials, fuelling trade distortions.T', u'The panel called for the subsidies to be withdrawn within 90 days.A', u'Airbus was represented by the European Union in the case while the US federal government fought for Boeing and Washington state because companies and regional authorities do not have standing at the Geneva-based WTO.B', u'Boeing said it expects the US to appeal against the decision."', u'"After any appeal, we fully expect Boeing to preserve every aspect of the Washington state incentives, including the 777X revenue tax rate," said J. Michael Luttig, Boeing\'s general counsel.A', u"According to Airbus's own estimates, Washington state has given Boeing tax breaks worth $8.7 billion (8.2 billion euros) in a scheme scheduled to run through 2040.B", u'Boeing has dismissed those numbers, putting the benefits to date at a maximum of $1 billion."', u'"The 777X will not cost Boeing a single dollar to develop thanks to Washington State\'s taxpayers," Airbus president Fabrice Bregier said in a statement of the aircraft that is expected to be market ready by 2020."', u'"This cannot go on any longer. It is time for the US Trade Representative to insist that Boeing cease its anti-competitive behaviour," he added.T', u'The WTO, which aims to create a level playing field in global trade, does not have the ability to force compliance with its rulings, but can approve retaliatory measures which in theory can pressure trade manipulators to fall into line.C', u'Calling Monday\'s ruling "an important victory for the EU," the bloc\'s trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said she expected the United States "to respect the rules, uphold fair competition and withdraw these subsidies without any delay."A spokesman for the US Trade Representative said the agency was reviewing the ruling, but suggested it was ready to fight on behalf of the US aerospace giant."', u'"This case is a small fraction of the overall aerospace dispute, on which the WTO has found overwhelmingly in the United States\' favor," spokesman Matt McAlvanah said in a statement, adding that "the US government will continue to hold the EU to account for illegal, market distorting subsidies.".- Tit-for-Tat -The EU has also been reprimanded by the WTO during the tit-for-tat conflict between Airbus and Boeing.I', u'In September, a WTO panel found that Brussels had not respected a 2011 ruling ordering it to take steps to withdraw several support and subsidy programmes for Airbus.T', u'The WTO did not put a value on those programmes but Boeing said they amounted to $22 billion worth of illegal support for Airbus development and sales. ', u'The EU has appealed against that decision, insisting that the subsidies in question had been discontinued. ', u'Meanwhile, a separate 2012 WTO ruling on benefits Boeing received from federal, state and local governments in the US remains a source of dispute, with a report on the issue due out in the coming months. - A new industry-wide pact? - A', u'Airbus Group chief executive Tom Enders described the seemingly never-ending spat with Boeing as "a ridiculous series of disputes initiated by the US." I', u'In seeking to move past drawn-out, costly squabbles at the WTO, Enders called for an agreement "on a set of globally applicable rules for the support of the civil aircraft industry, which would benefit both sides of the Atlantic." H', u'He noted that the battle for aviation contracts was no longer just Airbus versus Boeing. ', u'Aircraft maker Bombardier has received massive support from the Canadian government, while Russian and Asian firms have increasingly become market players, Enders said. ', u'"We need a global framework," he continued. ', u'"This WTO battle is a battle of the past which benefits only the armies of lawyers both sides employ for more than a decade."']

[u'ShutterstockBreathe deep. ', u'While Black Friday may seem like the end-all of holiday shopping season events, it s really just the kick-off. ', u'From now through December, budget-conscious shoppers will find themselves awash in outstanding opportunities to stretch their gift-buying dollar and Cyber Monday stands out as a great chance to take advantage of those deep discounts while sitting at home and sipping coffee. ', u'Or gin if you had a particularly rough Thanksgiving. ', u'We re not here to judge. ', u'We are, however, here to present you with a few tips and the best deals that have been announced so far.P', u'Plan Your Cyber Monday Campaign And Keep Calm1. ', u'No war is won without a sound strategy. ', u'Write out your list of folks, pick one or two gifts in a broad sense that you want to get for them instead of focusing on brands (i.e. your uncle Dennis might want a stand mixer, not a Kitchenaid). ', u'And then and only then dive into the deep, ever-sprawling pile of deals that is Cyber Monday.2. ', u'The mixture of holiday shopping pressure, and tactics like Amazon s rather shameless timer on deals and steadily climbing  percentage sold  progress bar, can make shoppers just as unhinged as any fistfight over an iPhone case. ', u'So, before you leap into the sprawl, remember that if you, or your giftee, won t use it, it doesn t matter how cheap it is.3. ', u'Deals come back all the time. ', u'It s easy to forget that prices are decided by the seller, and if somebody decides they can move a TV at a 70% discount, odds are fairly good that discount will return again before Christmas Eve, or another seller will try to top it. ', u'And don t forget; the same scams used on Black Friday also pop up on Cyber Monday, so plan accordingly! ', u'So with that, let s look at some deals!T', u'TelevisionsBest BuyWhile there are some surprising Cyber Monday deals out there, like a $700 savings on this 55  LG TV from Best Buy, the best deal is easily Wal-Mart unloading its entire stock of Samsung TVs at 50% off. ', u'That s dirt, dirt cheap, and if you need a replacement tube, this will definitely fit the bill. ', u'That said, if you need a smaller TV and want a gift card to go with it, Target is selling a 43  Ultra HD Samsung TV for $400 plus a $50 gift card.T', u'TabletsThere s never any contest on Cyber Monday for who has the best deals on their own products. ', u'Amazon, as usual, is celebrating Cyber Monday by cutting prices on all their stuff. ', u'If you use a tablet to surf the web, play games, and Tweet from the couch, the 7  Fire is perfect.L', u'LaptopsCyber Monday is usually a laptop bonanza, and this year is no exception. ', u'Whether you re looking for a gaming laptop, a dirt-cheap workhorse, or an absurdly high-end replacement for your desktop straight out of Hackers for $150 off.T', u'The best deal? $200 to $400 off Microsoft s Surface, when you buy it direct from Microsoft, which delivers on the promise of a notebook meeting a laptop and then some. ', u'That ll also likely make it cheaper than an iPad depending on where you find your deals.V', u'Video GamesSonyExpect a lot of game deals on Cyber Monday, both in the form of digital sales and in the form of boxed games. ', u'In terms of consoles, though, the best deals are all on the Xbox One. ', u'So far, the best deal is buying an Xbox One S bundle directly from Microsoft; anybody who does that gets an immediate $50 discount, a better deal than some Black Friday game sales. ', u'If you own a giant 4K TV and not an Xbox One S, however, consider Wal-Mart s offer of the console, a $40 gift card, and a 4K movie for just $250. ', u'Almost as good is Best Buy s deal where you buy a Xbox One S bundle and get a controller to go with it; the savings aren t quite as deep but they re pretty good and ideal for gamers who share the couch with someone.I', u'In non-Xbox news, Amazon is offering some truly ridiculous Cyber Monday deals in gaming, ranging from accessories to, of course, games themselves. ', u'Look closely, though, as some are week-long deals and others are on a timer.I', u'Internet WidgetsWhether yelling at Google s air-freshener-esque Home or Amazon s hockey-puck-styled Echo Dot or the Echo itself will ever be a thing is an open question, but they fail it won t be for pricing. ', u'Amazon has trimmed $40 off the Echo, making it $140 and $10 off the Dot, making it $40. ', u'Google has the Home at $30 off, meanwhile, so it only costs $100.E', u'Everything ElseFinally, there s the category that Cyber Monday really exists for: Totally strange stuff you didn t know existed, but you or someone in your life desperately need. ', u'For the college student in your life, a $10 Aroma rice cooker that cooks up to 14 cups is a deal. ', u'If you want to learn Spanish, you can get Rosetta Stone and a Kindle Fire together for $150. ', u'And if you just want a jump on Christmas, or get the dad in your life a tree that won t shed needles, a fake Colorado Spruce with color-changing lights built in is just $225 from Lowe s.F', u'For a look at more must-have gifts this holiday season, take a look at our other guides.']

[u'ShutterstockIn the United States and many other countries, the  cashless  approach is a simple one when cards are accepted almost anywhere and people conduct their entire existence via smartphone.

', u'The new move, which Modi declared via national radio address, follows another controversial decision to ban the country s 500-rupee and 1000-rupees notes. ', u'This has reportedly made daily transactions immensely difficult for millions of citizens.M', u'Modi concedes that his plan is a long-term one but hopes that people will soon embrace digital payments. ', u'He has reasons for doing so, including deterring tax avoidance, bribery and   most importantly   sources of terrorism funding.

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   You might have thought about it, heard it. ', u'You might have even felt it: Dictionary.com\'s word of the year is "xenophobia."While it\'s difficult to get at exactly why people look up words in dictionaries, online or on paper, it\'s clear that in contentious 2016, fear of "otherness" bruised the collective consciousness around the globe.T', u"The Brexit vote, police violence against people of color, Syria's refugee crisis, transsexual rights and the U.S. presidential race were among prominent developments that drove debate   and spikes in lookups of the word, said Jane Solomon, one of the dictionary site's lexicographers.T", u'The 21-year-old site defines xenophobia as "fear or hatred of foreigners, people from different cultures, or strangers." And it plans to expand its entry to include fear or dislike of "customs, dress and cultures of people with backgrounds different from our own," Solomon said in a recent interview.T', u"The word didn't enter the English language until the late 1800s, she said. ", u'Its roots are in two Greek words   "xenos," meaning "stranger or guest," and "phobos," meaning "fear or panic," Solomon added.T', u'The interest was clear June 24, within a period that represents the largest spike in lookups of xenophobia so far this year. ', u'That was the day of Brexit, when the UK voted to leave the European Union.S', u'Searches for xenophobia on the site increased by 938 percent from June 22 to June 24, Solomon said. ', u'Lookups spiked again that month after President Obama\'s June 29 speech in which he insisted that Donald Trump\'s campaign rhetoric was not a measure of "populism," but rather "nativism, or xenophobia, or worse."Solomon added that chatter about xenophobia goes well beyond the spikes."', u'"It has been significant throughout the year," she said. ', u'"But after the EU referendum, hundreds and hundreds of users were looking up the term every hour."Robert Reich, who served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and was President Clinton\'s labor secretary, felt so strongly about xenophobia\'s prominence today that he appears in a video for Dictionary.com discussing its ramifications."', u'"I don\'t think most people even know what xenophobia is," Reich, who teaches public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview. ', u'"It\'s a word not to be celebrated but to be deeply concerned about."Solomon\'s site, based in Oakland, California, started choosing a word of the year in 2010, based on search data and agreement of in-house experts that include a broad swath of the company, from lexicographers to the marketing and product teams to the CEO, Liz McMillan.T', u'The word and the sentiment reflect a broader mournful tone to 2016, with Oxford dictionary editors choosing "post-truth" as their word of the year, often described in terms of politics as belonging to a time in which truth has become irrelevant."', u'"I wish," Solomon said, "we could have chosen a word like unicorns."']

[u'Donald Trump may very well be able to persuade companies like Carrier to keep jobs in the United States instead of moving them to lower-cost countries such as Mexico. ', u'But pressuring companies to accept higher production costs, which Trump is essentially doing, could easily backfire and destroy more jobs than if Trump were to do nothing.T', u'Trump is trying to fulfill a campaign promise by jawboning Carrier, the heating and air conditioning subsidiary of United Technologies (UTX), into reversing plans to close an Indiana factory announced earlier this year. ', u'Carrier said in February it planned to move 1,400 jobs from Indiana, where workers average about $34 per hour in pay and benefits, to Monterey, Mexico, where comparable pay is about $6 per hour.T', u'Trump is reportedly seeking various forms of leverage to compel Carrier to cancel the move. ', u'Carrier s parent company, United Technologies, is a big defense contractor that earns about $5 billion in annual revenue from government contracts on fighter-jet engines and other types of weaponry. ', u'So Washington could make those contracts contingent on keeping other jobs in America. ', u'Trump is also reportedly considering tax cuts or regulatory relief that could be targeted at Carrier, offsetting some or all of the cost of keeping the work in America. ', u'He has seemingly backed off his campaign pledge of slapping 35% tariffs on air conditioners imported from Mexico to the United States, to punish any company that relocates production south of the border.S', u'Such tactics could allow the incoming president to declare victory if the company reverses its outsourcing plans, as Ford Motor Co. (F) seemingly did when it said it would keep some production for its Lincoln brand at a Kentucky plant instead of moving it to Mexico. ', u'Trump tweeted afterward that  I worked hard with Bill Ford [the company s chairman] to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky. ', u'Maybe so, but Trump s meddling with the production plans of US manufacturers could end up raising their costs, making their products less competitive and endangering the very jobs Trump is trying to save.G', u'Giving global competitors an edgeIf companies like Carrier only sold their products in the United States and competed only against other US firms, the case for keeping the jobs here would be simpler and stronger. ', u'But no country s economy works like that anymore, and inefficiencies at any one company give competitors a pricing or quality edge. ', u'Carrier must worry about competition from other producers, some of whom may produce all their products in low-cost overseas plants,  says economist Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution. ', u'If Carrier loses US and overseas business and profits because its manufacturing costs are higher than those of its competitors, the US plants may ultimately shrink or close. ', u'Carrier s competitors include Trane and American Standard, both owned by Ingersoll-Rand (IR), which is based in Dublin, Ireland; Rheem, headquartered in Atlanta; and Goodman, owned by Daikin, a Japanese conglomerate. ', u'Each has manufacturing operations all over the world. ', u'If any one company has higher costs than another whether labor, components or anything else its products will be more expensive than the competition and sales will most likely decline. ', u'If you can t cut costs, the only choice often is to skimp on quality, which erodes profits even more. ', u'This is true for all appliances and just about every other sort of manufactured good.I', u'If Trump s corporate arm-twisting were to prevail, a company like Carrier probably would keep more jobs in the United States, at least for a while. ', u'But its sales would decline compared with competitors able to undercut it on price. ', u'Trump could pursue aggressive tariffs on imports, to force competing prices up as well. ', u'But higher prices usually lead to lower sales across the board, while hurting consumers who must purchase those products. ', u'Businesses bear those higher costs as well, and they ll have less money to hire people if other costs go up.I', u'If profitability at any given company were poor enough, some producers would get out of the business altogether. ', u'And none of this accounts for the possibility of retaliatory tariffs on US exports to other countries, a likely tit-for-tat outcome that would further cut into American production.T', u'Trump has identified a legitimate problem in the decline of opportunity for working-class Americans who used to be able to make a decent living working with their hands. ', u'But contorting the parts of capitalism that work investing money where it gets the highest return, wringing out inefficiencies would harm the people Trump is trying to help.T', u'Tax cuts on corporate income might be a gentler way to encourage companies to keep work in the United States, although that would benefit the shareholder class well before any of it trickles down to ordinary workers. ', u'Cutting regulations, as Trump vows to do, would leave companies with more money to spend, but there s still no guarantee they ll spend it on costly jobs for American workers when they might get a better return on the money investing it some other way.T', u'The man Trump will replace in January, President Obama, tried to help displaced workers by making college education more affordable and providing skill training that would enable them to do more sophisticated work. ', u'Those are reasonable ideas that won t become obsolete just because Obama leaves office. ', u'If Trump s tough talk doesn t get the job done, maybe he ll try a softer approach.R', u'Rick Newman is the author of four books, including . ', u'Follow him on Twitter: .']

[u"By Sankalp Phartiyal and Euan RochaBENGALURU (Reuters) - Anticipating a more protectionist U.S. technology visa program under a Donald Trump administration, India's $150 billion IT services sector will speed up acquisitions in the United States and recruit more heavily from college campuses there.I", u'Indian companies including Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Wipro have long used H1-B skilled worker visas to fly computer engineers to the U.S., their largest overseas market, temporarily to service clients.S', u'Staff from those three companies accounted for around 86,000 new H1-B workers in 2005-14. ', u'The U.S. currently issues close to that number of H1-B visas each year.P', u'President-elect Trump\'s campaign rhetoric, and his pick for Attorney General of Senator Jeff Sessions, a long-time critic of the visa program, have many expecting a tighter regime."', u'"The world over, there\'s a lot of protectionism coming in and push back on immigration. Unfortunately, people are confusing immigration with a high-skilled temporary workforce, because we are really a temporary workforce," said Pravin Rao, chief operating officer at Infosys, India\'s second-largest information technology firm.W', u'While few expect a complete shutdown of skilled worker visas as Indian engineers are an established part of the fabric of Silicon Valley, and U.S. businesses depend on their cheaper IT and software solutions, any changes are likely to push up costs.A', u'And a more restrictive program would likely mean Indian IT firms sending fewer developers and engineers to the United States, and increasing campus recruitment there."', u'"We have to accelerate hiring of locals if they are available, and start recruiting freshers from universities there," said Infosys\' Rao, noting a shift from the traditional model of recruiting mainly experienced people in the U.S."', u'"Now we have to get into a model where we will recruit freshers, train them and gradually deploy them, and this will increase our costs," he said, noting Infosys typically recruits 500-700 people each quarter in the U.S. and Europe, around 80 percent of whom are locals.A', u"ACQUISITIONSTrump's election win and Britain's referendum vote to leave the European Union are headwinds for India's IT sector, as clients such as big U.S. and British banks and insurers hold off on spending while the dust settles.I", u"In India's IT hub of Bengaluru and the financial capital Mumbai, executives expect a Trump administration to raise the minimum wage for foreign workers, pressuring already squeezed margins.B", u'Buying U.S. companies would help Indian IT firms build their local headcount, increase their on-the-ground presence in key markets and help counter any protectionist regulations.I', u'Indian software services companies have invested more than $2 billion in the United States in the past five years. ', u'North America accounts for more than half of the sector\'s revenue."', u'"We have to accelerate acquisitions," said Rao at Infosys, which in the past two years has bought companies including U.S.-based Noah Consulting and Kallidus Technologies.J', u"Jatin Dalal, Wipro's chief financial officer, said his growth strategy is to buy companies that offer something beyond what Wipro already does, or new, disruptive firms - such as Appirio, a U.S. cloud services firm.T", u'The chief executive of Tech Mahindra, C.P. ', u'Gurnani, said his firm, which two years ago bought network services management firm Lightbridge Communications Corp, is on the look-out for more U.S. acquisitions, particularly in healthcare and fintech - financial technology firms that are disrupting traditional banking services.O', u'OFFSHORING & AUTOMATION I', u'In a broader shift from labor intensive onsite projects, Indian IT firms are also turning to higher-tech services such as automation, cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms. ', u'With better technology and faster networks, IT firms are encouraging Western clients to adopt more virtual services. ', u'Infosys CEO Vishal Sikka says he has focused on automation and AI as growth drivers since 2014. ', u'"The AI platform is 5-6 percent of our revenues," he told Reuters. ', u'"Three years ago, it was zero." M', u'More automation would mean fewer onshore developers.

[u'Getty ImageEngineers in San Francisco can t seem to agree why the city s Millennium Tower, a largely residential building, is sinking and doing so at a steady rate to boot.

', u'But the situation quickly turned into a war of words, as Johnston mentioned the railway station, and San Francisco s Transbay Joint Powers Authority brought up the foundation argument.T', u'To help combat the issues, the building hired engineers to drill holes to test soil samples to determine if the sinking has subsided. ', u'But tenants, including Jerry Dodson, said the developers reassured them the sinking had stopped. ', u'Now, he s not so sure of that, saying  To have the space agency looking at it debunks what (developers) have put out there.

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   You might have thought about it, heard it.

And it plans to expand its entry to include fear or dislike of "customs, dress and cultures of people with backgrounds different from our own," Solomon said in a recent interview.T', u"The word didn't enter the English language until the late 1800s, she said. ", u'Its roots are in two Greek words   "xenos," meaning "stranger or guest," and "phobos," meaning "fear or panic," Solomon added.T', u'The interest was clear June 24, within a period that represents the largest spike in lookups of xenophobia so far this year. ', u'That was the day of Brexit, when the UK voted to leave the European Union.S', u'Searches for xenophobia on the site increased by 938 percent from June 22 to June 24, Solomon said. ', u'Lookups spiked again that month after President Obama\'s June 29 speech in which he insisted that Donald Trump\'s campaign rhetoric was not a measure of "populism," but rather "nativism, or xenophobia, or worse."Solomon added that chatter about xenophobia goes well beyond the spikes."', u'"It has been significant throughout the year," she said. ', u'"But after the EU referendum, hundreds and hundreds of users were looking up the term every hour."Robert Reich, who served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter and was President Clinton\'s labor secretary, felt so strongly about xenophobia\'s prominence today that he appears in a video for Dictionary.com discussing its ramifications."', u'"I don\'t think most people even know what xenophobia is," Reich, who teaches public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, said in an interview. ', u'"It\'s a word not to be celebrated but to be deeply concerned about."Solomon\'s site, based in Oakland, California, started choosing a word of the year in 2010, based on search data and agreement of in-house experts that include a broad swath of the company, from lexicographers to the marketing and product teams to the CEO, Liz McMillan.T', u'The word and the sentiment reflect a broader mournful tone to 2016, with Oxford dictionary editors choosing "post-truth" as their word of the year, often described in terms of politics as belonging to a time in which truth has become irrelevant."', u'"I wish," Solomon said, "we could have chosen a word like unicorns."']

[u'Samsung is trying its best to move on and forget about the Galaxy Note 7 fiasco.

', u'South Korean publication ET News reported Tuesday that Samsung is actually planning to incorporate automatic focus (AF) function to the Galaxy S8 s selfie camera.

[u'WuITU ABA, South China Sea (Reuters) - Taiwan held rescue drills on Tuesday off the coast of its sole outpost in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea, but the biggest claimant in the disputed area kept uncharacteristically quiet.C', u"China and self-governed Taiwan seldom see eye to eye, but in responding to Taipei's latest assertion of sovereignty over Itu Aba, Beijing has avoided the harsh language it often directs at other claimants to the busy waterway.C", u'China, Taiwan, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei claim parts or all of the energy-rich South China Sea, through which trillions of dollars in trade passes annually.T', u"Taiwan and China both suffered setbacks to their claims in July, when an international tribunal ruled that China's historic boundary, the so-called nine-dash line, was invalid, and said Itu Aba was a rock, rather than a self-sustaining island entitled to a 200-km economic zone.E", u'Experts say Beijing is largely content for Taipei to push its claims on Itu Aba, the largest natural feature in the Spratlys, because China views Taiwan as a breakaway province to be taken back by force one day, if necessary.S', u'So, while Chinese ships have confronted Malaysian, Philippine and Vietnamese vessels in the area, Taiwan\'s regular journeys to and from the lonely outcrop have gone unimpeded."', u'"Our supply transports have never encountered Chinese interference," Lee Chung-wei, minister of Taiwan\'s Coast Guard Administration, told reporters visiting Itu Aba for the rescue drills.I', u"In the exercises, coast guard vessels and navy helicopters practised how to retrieve injured crewmen from a burning ship and transport them to Itu Aba's small port and hospital.P", u'PROTECTING SOVEREIGNTYAsked about the drills on Itu Aba, and whether Taiwan had an obligation to respect Chinese sovereignty there, China\'s foreign ministry underscored its desire for a unified approach."', u'"The Nansha Islands, including Taiping Island, are inseparable parts of China," spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily briefing in Beijing, using China\'s terms for the Spratlys and Itu Aba. ', u'"Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait have an obligation to jointly protect this ancestral property."Drills such as Tuesday\'s show Taiwan\'s determination to become an important player, said Ian Storey, a South China Sea scholar at Singapore s ISEAS Yusof Ishak Institute, adding that Taiwan officials and experts had told him of frustration at being diplomatically marginalized in the South China Sea.T', u'Taiwan treads a fine line between annoying friendly South East Asian neighbors and the United States, its sole political ally and arms supplier, by being a proxy for China s sovereign interests, despite the risk of angering Beijing, he added."', u'"It is a tricky position that means they are broadly supportive of Beijing," Storey said. ', u'"They want to be seen as pushing their own Chinese claims, rather than Beijing\'s, even though they are essentially the same."Taiwan officials say President Tsai Ing-wen kicked off plans for the drills in July, a month after Beijing cut official communication channels because Tsai, who leads the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), refuses to commit to the \'one China\' principle that Taiwan is part of the mainland.T', u'To maintain ties, Tsai must continue arguing that Itu Aba is an island, not a rock, and is not to be used by military forces of other nations, said Wu Shicun, head of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies."', u'"Doing so would likely mean that they would threaten China s sovereignty in the South China Sea," said Chinese government adviser Wu. ', u'"If she steps over these red lines, I believe China will take responsive action."

They worked in regular construction clothes."About 30 of the cleanup workers known as liquidators were killed on site or died from overwhelming radiation poisoning in the following weeks.T', u'The Soviets sought to try to cover up the accident that was caused by errors during an experimental safety check and its eventual toll is still hotly disputed.T', u'The United Nations estimated in 2005 that around 4,000 people had either been killed or were left dying from cancer and other related diseases.B', u'But the Greenpeace environmental protection group believes the figure may be closer to 100,000.A', u'Authorities maintain a 30-kilometre-wide (19-mile) exclusion zone around the plant in which only a few dozen elderly people live.- 30-year lifespan -One of the main problems of the Soviet-era response was the fact that it only had a 30-year lifespan.Y', u'Yet its deterioration began much sooner than that. ', u'"Radioactive dust inside the structure is being blown out through the cracks," Sergiy Paskevych of Ukraine\'s Institute of Nuclear Power Plant Safety Problems told AFP.

', u'Kiev has complained that European assistance was slow to materialise. ', u'The EBRD found 40 state sponsors to fund a competition in 2007 to choose who should build the massive moveable dome. ', u'A French consortium of two companies known as Novarka finished the designs in 2010 and began construction two years later. ', u'The shelter was edged towards the fourth reactor in just under three weeks of delicate work this month that was interrupted by bad weather and other potential dangers. ', u'It will later be fitted with radiation control equipment as well as air vents and fire fighting measures. ', u'The equipment inside the arch is expected to be operative by the end of 2017. ', u'"Only then will we begin to disassemble the old, unstable structure," State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine\'s head Sergiy Bozhko told AFP. ', u'But he said no timeframe had yet been set for the particularly hazardous work of removing all the remaining nuclear fuel from inside the plant or dismantling the old dome.

And executing is an all too appropriate word," he said.R', u'Russia\'s envoy, Vitaly Churkin, brushed off criticism and said Syria was seeking to eliminate extremists such as the Al-Nusra Front, which has rebranded itself the Fateh al-Sham Front after severing ties to Al-Qaeda."', u'"We vehemently condemn any attempts to protect terrorists including any political action on a humanitarian pretext which, sadly alas, UN humanitarian works have been dragged into," Churkin said.H', u'He accused Western powers of hypocrisy, saying there were also great humanitarian needs in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul and Yemen where the United States is on the opposite side.T', u'The US ambassador, Samantha Power, urged the Security Council to pass a resolution sponsored by Egypt, New Zealand and Spain that would mandate a 10-day military halt to allow humanitarian supplies to enter Aleppo."', u'"This is a no-brainer. Anyone who tells you otherwise does not have the survival of Syrian civilians at heart," Power said. ', u'But she feared a new Russian veto and acknowledged a brief halt "is barely even a Band-Aid and it is a sign in some ways of just how low our bar has become."']

[u'Jason Miller, communications director for President-elect Donald Trump s transition team, urged the media Monday to focus on  issues of both voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting  rather than an election recount that he dismissed as  nonsensical  and a  shiny object. ', u'Miller s comments came on the transition team s daily press call when he was asked about a series of tweets Trump sent on Sunday asserting that he  won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally. ', u'His campaign has provided no evidence for the claim, and outside experts say it has no merit.T', u'Trump made his comments in response to news that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s campaign is participating in a recount of the voting in Wisconsin that was requested by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. ', u'The recount can take place with or without Clinton s involvement, but she has the right to have observers present, and evidently intends to exercise it. ', u'Clinton campaign general counsel Marc Elias said the campaign would also participate in recounts of Pennsylvania and Michigan if Stein is successful in initiating them.S', u'Stein s recount push came after a group of computer science experts said they detected statistical anomalies in voting patterns in those states that possibly benefited Trump. ', u'Other experts have dismissed these claims and Elias has said the Clinton campaign has found no evidence of irregularities. ', u'Trump won in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and Clinton would need to flip the results in all three   considered extremely unlikely   to change the outcome in the Electoral College.O', u'On Twitter, Trump dismissed the recount as a  Green Party scam. ', u'He went on to allege there was  serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California,  all states won by Clinton. ', u'Trump is not requesting recounts in those states. ', u'His comments were widely discounted because there is no independent evidence that large numbers of people  voted illegally. ', u'The claim seems to have originated as an Internet conspiracy theory.D', u'During Monday s transition team press call, Miller was asked if he had any evidence of illegal voting in the three blue states. ', u'Thanks for bringing that up,  Miller replied, but answered instead by attacking Clinton for backing a recount. ', u'He pointed out that Clinton initially conceded the election to Trump. ', u'He added that Elias, her campaign s general counsel, has called for North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory to concede and stop contesting his reelection loss even though it was by a  much smaller margin. ', u'I really do think that it s been ridiculous that so much oxygen has been given to a recount effort where there s absolutely no chance of any election results changing. ', u'This election has been decided. ', u'It s a conceded election,  Miller said.I', u'In support of Trump s assertions, Miller cited reports of people who were improperly registered to vote   including a disputed Washington Post article from 2014 that cited data showing  more than 14 percent of noncitizens  indicated they were registered to vote in polling conducted for a study in 2008 and 2010. ', u'He also pointed to a Pew Research study from 2012 that found  approximately 24 million   one of every eight   voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or are significantly inaccurate  and that  approximately 2.75 million people have registrations in more than one state. ', u'So, all of these are studies or examples where there have been issues of both voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting,  said Miller. ', u'So, if this much attention and oxygen is going to be given to a completely frivolous throwaway fundraising scheme by someone like Jill Stein, then there should be actual, substantive looks at the overall examples of voter fraud and illegal immigrants voting in recent years. ', u'And so that s the broader message that I think should be taken away here. ', u'Pressed by reporters, Miller did not cite any specific evidence of illegal voting, as distinguished from improper registrations. ', u'Asked if there was a chance Trump would push federal or local officials to investigate voter fraud when he takes office next January. ', u'Miller said it would be  inappropriate  for him to speculate about potential investigations, but he reiterated his view voter fraud is a  concern  that merits attention and press coverage. ', u'Obviously, I do think that it s an issue of concern, the fact that there s a concern that so many   voted who were not legally supposed to,  Miller said, before adding,  I think there s a responsibility from members of the media   to give an appropriate level of attention to some of these different concerns   as opposed to just chasing the shiny object of the Jill Stein recount effort, which is really just a way for Ms. Stein and the Green Party to make money. ', u'Stein s campaign claims to have raised over $6.3 million to file for recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan. ', u'The campaign initially said they would  need to raise about 2.5 million dollars collectively for all three states  for filing costs. ', u'Stein and her campaign have not responded to multiple requests for comment from Yahoo News about Trump s criticism of the effort.']

[u'Corporate America s biggest worry about incoming President Donald Trump is that he ll ignite trade wars with China, Mexico and other big exporters. ', u'His pick for Commerce Secretary, private-equity billionaire Wilbur Ross, says that s not going to happen. ', u'There aren t going to be trade wars,  Ross told Yahoo Finance the day after the election. ', u'There are plenty of things that could be done that would not be the end of the Earth but would help our trade balance. ', u'On the campaign trail, Trump talked tough about slapping quotas on cheap imports and punishing China if its currency appeared to be undervalued. ', u'If those things were to happen, it would make imports more expensive for American consumers, invite similar quotas on American exports and possibly cause a recession. ', u'Hence the worry in US boardrooms.B', u'But Ross, who as Commerce Secretary would lead any trade negotiations, describes a more benign approach. ', u'On Mexico, he points out that the United States accounts for 80% of Mexican exports, which gives the United States plenty of leverage to lean on its southern neighbor to buy more American-made products. ', u'If I m a guy s 80% customer, is he going to fight with me? ', u'No, he s going to negotiate. ', u'The goal, he says, wouldn t be to punish US companies that produce goods in Mexico, but to reduce America s $60 billion trade deficit with Mexico. ', u'That can be done two ways: by Mexico exporting less to the United States or buying more from it. ', u'Either could be accomplished, he says, without dismantling the North American Free Trade Agreement.T', u'The US trade deficit with China is about $335 billion. ', u'Ross highlights at least two ways to lower that. ', u'First, persuade China to buy more stuff from the United States that it currently imports from somewhere else. ', u'Example: energy products, such as liquefied natural gas (LNG). ', u'Trump is going to be promoting LNG and its export,  Ross says. ', u'It wouldn t be hard for [China] to buy more LNG from us than from the Gulf countries.  (Tip for investors: Keep an eye on energy stocks.)The second thing the United States can do is persuade China to ease its own limits on imports of American raw materials. ', u'They export to us lots of apparel and lots of footwear, but they have quotas on American exports of cotton,  Ross explains. ', u'They could relax those quotas. ', u'Ross makes it sound easy, but there s no guarantee trading partners will go along. ', u'If they don t, that s where Trump s stick would replace the carrot. ', u'If they won t negotiate,  says Ross,  then it may become necessary as a negotiating measure to threaten them with as much as a 45% tariff. ', u'That s not a rash statement. ', u'That gives you a flavor for his negotiating position. ', u'While campaigning, Trump often suggested such measures as a starting point, but Ross suggests they d be more of a last resort.T', u'Trump s trade policies would generate losers, especially if partners like China and Mexico bought more American products while reducing purchases from other countries. ', u'Russia sells a lot of gas to China and surely wouldn t get muscled aside by the Americans without protest. ', u'Many emerging markets supply Mexico and China as well, and they could suffer from reduced exports, with negative implications for financial markets. ', u'But Trump s stated goal is to put America first. ', u'We re starting to see how.R', u'Rick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.

[u'By Emily Stephenson and Melissa FaresINDIANAPOLIS, (Reuters) - U.S. ', u'President-elect Donald Trump visited a factory in Indiana on Thursday to kick off a "thank you tour" for his election win and celebrate persuading air conditioner maker Carrier Corp to preserve around 1,000 jobs in the state rather than move them to Mexico.T', u'The Republican businessman toured the plant in Indianapolis and shook hands with workers on an assembly line. ', u'He was due to make remarks there later in the day.I', u'In an early victory for Trump before he takes office on Jan. 20, Carrier said this week it agreed to keep more than 1,000 jobs at the plant and at its headquarters, while still planning to move more than 1,000 other U.S. jobs to Mexico.T', u'Trump made keeping jobs in the United States one of the main issues of his election campaign and frequently pilloried Carrier for planning to ship jobs overseas as he appealed to blue-collar workers in the Midwest.T', u'Though the company is still outsourcing Indiana jobs to Mexico, the deal marks a quick win for Trump, who has spent most of his time since the Nov. 8 election in New York building his team ahead of the handover of power from President Barack Obama.C', u'Carrier confirmed that Indiana agreed to give the company $7 million in tax incentives. ', u"A source briefed on the matter said the tax incentives are over 10 years and the company has agreed to invest $16 million in the state, which is run by Governor Mike Pence, Trump's vice president-elect.T", u'Trump spokesman Jason Miller told reporters the Carrier deal is proof that  this administration is going to make good on our promises to keep jobs here in America. ', u'But Carrier, a unit of United Technologies Corp ,still plans to move 600 jobs from the plant to Mexico, the Wall Street Journal said. ', u'Reuters reported earlier this week Carrier also still intends to close a factory in Huntington, Indiana, that employs 700 people making controls for heating, cooling and refrigeration and move the jobs to Mexico by 2018.U', u'Senator Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic primary to Clinton, said the Carrier deal is incomplete and leaves the incoming Trump administration open to threats from companies."', u'"Trump has endangered the jobs of workers who were previously safe in the United States. Why? Because he has signaled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives," Sanders wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece on Thursday.H', u'He noted that Trump had originally said he would save 2,100 jobs that Carrier planned to move to Mexico."', u'"Let s be clear: It is not good enough to save some of these jobs," Sanders said.D', u"Despite Trump's deal, employers elsewhere in Indiana are laying off five times that many workers because of foreign competition.M", u'Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim said on Thursday that if Trump succeeds as U.S. president, it would benefit major trading partner Mexico because of increased employment and U.S. economic growth.C', u'CINCINNATI RALLYTrump was due to hold a rally in Cincinnati, Ohio, later on Thursday and address supporters who helped him win that swing state in his stunning victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.T', u"The Indiana and Ohio stops will be Trump's first public events since he won the presidency. ", u'At the Cincinnati event, Trump and Pence will talk about what is ahead and the  positive change  Trump will bring to the country, spokesman Miller said. ', u'Trump\'s Cincinnati rally looks like it will echoes the raucous events that characterized his campaign, in which he railed against Washington insiders and Wall Street and vowed to "drain the swamp." B', u'But now Trump is turning to establishment figures to fill critical positions in his administration. ', u'On Wednesday, Trump said he would nominate former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin, to lead the Treasury Department. ', u'Trump named Wilbur Ross, a billionaire known for his investments in distressed industries, as his nominee for commerce secretary. ', u'The Trump team has also tapped a series of experienced Washington hands to oversee the transfer of power within government departments and agencies. ', u'The real estate mogul and former television celebrity, who has never before held elected office, has named some members of his Cabinet but has many other jobs to fill. ', u'The Cincinnati rally follows a car and knife attack this week by a Somali immigrant and Muslim student, Abdul Razak Ali Artan, at Ohio State University in Columbus that left 11 people injured, for which Islamic State claimed responsibility. ', u'In a Twitter message, Trump said, "ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country." T', u'The Council on American-Islamic Relations accused Trump of seeking to exploit the "tragic situation in Ohio." (Additional reporting by Steve Holland and David Shepardson.

[u'Most people are used to putting anti-virus software on their computer, but here s a friendly reminder your phone requires protection as well: more than one million Android devices have been infected by a particularly bad bit of malware, according to a  report from Check Point Software Technologies.T', u'The team of security researchers have been tracking the family malicious code, which they dubbed Gooligan, that has burrowed its way into Android phones and tablets around the world, including hundreds of enterprise devices.T', u'The infections stem primarily from apps found in third-party app stores, which are often less-regulated alternatives to the Google Play Store that people turn to for free apps. ', u'Check Point reported at least 86 apps have been found to have traces of Gooligan, most of which appear legitimate and have been given artificially high ratings in the app store.O', u'Once one of the infected apps is installed onto a user s device, either from an app store or by clicking a malicious link, it begins collecting data about the device and reporting it to a command and control server a centralized computer that issues commands to and receives reports from devices.T', u'The malware then downloads a rootkit, which is used to gain unauthorized access to device. ', u'Once it has successfully rooted the phone, Gooligan injects code to avoid detection while going about its business.

', u'In the post, Ludwig said Google has worked closely with Check Point to track Gooligan and its variants.H', u'He also notes while the infections may be widespread, there is  no evidence of user data access.

[u'But this kind of self-expressive politics has been matched around the world. ', u'That s the product of modernity. ', u'Politics become individualized and primarily a mode for self-expression. ', u'So you see the same thing happening in France, in Great Britain, in all these places, where parties   on the left and the right   that are more expressive come to the fore.P', u'People as they grow richer   and this comes straight out of research from Ron Inglehart at the University of Michigan   as people become richer they lose their respect for authority, and that s what s happened in this country since the mid-1960s. ', u'People no longer have the need to obey. ', u'The history was, as people s survival became assured, which happens in the welfare state, they no longer have the need to belong to church or family or community, and as a result, respect for authority in all forms   science, business, labor unions, political groups   declines, and the values of self-expression and individual rights increase.T', u'The structures that surrounded people s lives   community, and what family meant, and church and tradition   all become less important. ', u'People become, to use the sociology phrase, disembedded from those institutions. ', u'And they re on their own and become artists of their own lives and their primary occupation becomes describing themselves to themselves and to others. ', u'Thus Facebook. ', u'You become your own personal brand, and you have to constantly define and describe yourself to others. ', u'So the place where you live has to express your self, so that s why you see this lifestyle sorting.A', u'And then politics becomes more about finding the best expressive mode for describing one s self. ', u'And Bernie or Trump or Marine Le Pen, or whoever it is who has a stronger expressive value, those politicians come to the front. ', u'It has nothing to do with policy.I', u'It s more about finding the politics that allows us to express ourselves more fully. ', u'That becomes the most important thing.H', u'How do you turn back from the prosperity and the technology and globalization of modernity? ', u'You don t. We look for individual solutions for everything, and in politics we look for the individual solution in the form of the unique personality, and that could be Bernie and that could be Trump. ', u'It s certainly not Hillary or Jeb. ', u'The question is why do these right-wing expressive candidates seem to have more power, and I don t know the answer to that.A', u'Adam Goodheart, author of  1861: The Civil War Awakening  and director of Washington College s C.V.

', u'The country was going to be something new, and the question was: What new thing would that be? ', u'Who would hold the power and how broadly would that power be shared?E', u'Every moment is different. ', u'It s this common truism that history repeats itself. ', u'Well, actually, it doesn t really repeat itself. ', u'It echoes itself. ', u'If there is anything that history teaches us, it s that there always is something new, and we ve never had a moment quite like this one before. ', u'We ve never had anybody like Donald Trump step into the presidency before. ', u'I really don t think there are any useful comparisons in American history I can think of.T', u'The imperial presidency as we ve known it is at most a little more than a century old. ', u'And we ve certainly not had anyone come to the White House in that time who is as outspokenly dedicated to tearing down America s civic and political and constitutional norms and traditions, and as unabashedly authoritarian, as Donald Trump.S', u'So it s safe to say that s unprecedented. ', u'It may even really be unprecedented in any healthy modern democracy.G', u'Groups split and recombine and split again through American history, and at some times in American history we ve faced enormous splits, within, say, the white rural working class, and most dramatically the Civil War. ', u'Right now we seem to have a kind of a consolidation of the white rural, working and middle class throughout every region of the country. ', u'But we ve seen huge realignments in the past, probably most recently in the 1960s, and so we know that we see realignments periodically, and that new coalitions will form and split apart again.I', u'I suppose if there s hope to be found, it s that our democracy has so far managed to accommodate those transitions and only truly come off the rails once in 240 years.R', u'Richard Florida, author of  The Rise of the Creative Class,  co-founder of City Lab and author of the forthcoming  The New Urban Crisis: How Out Cities Are Increasing Inequality, Deepening Segregation, and Failing the Middle Class   and What We Can Do About It What really shocks me is that this is the first time in my life it looks like the United States is really on the wrong side of history.W', u'We avoided the other isms. ', u'We avoided authoritarianism. ', u'We avoided totalitarianism. ', u'We avoided fascism. ', u'And even though our crises were deep and our divides were deep, we were a society that was forward-looking, that was on history s right side. ', u'I mean, we had the McCarthy era, we had all sorts of blips in our history   but Joseph McCarthy wasn t our president. ', u'Now, it looks to me, America, for the first time in modern memory, has elected a president who is on the wrong side of history.W', u'We ran correlations between Clinton and Trump voters: comparisons of Clinton to Obama, and Trump to Romney voters. ', u'The correlations were off the charts, they were 0.9. ', u'This is state vote share, so I m comparing Clinton vote share to Obama, Trump voter share to Romney. ', u'The divide looks the same, more or less. ', u'It s more acute, but it s not like the tables have turned dramatically in terms of the divide in America. ', u'Those correlations are all similar.A', u'And I think what happened is that in these locations   the stressed suburbs, exurban areas, rural areas   that s where Trump tipped states from blue to red. ', u'So our divide is not that different from when we went into this election; it s these tipping point communities in certain states that were blue for Obama and red for Trump. ', u'And also a lot of voters who were part of the Obama coalition stayed home. ', u'I think this poses problems for America. ', u'Trump will be the candidate of not-the-cities. ', u'Clinton won the cities. ', u'According to the Washington Post analysis, Trump won the suburbs, exurban areas and the rural areas. ', u'Cities are engines   density powers innovation   the engines that drive our economy and create progress. ', u'This is a backlash against our very sources of progress, and that s what worries me. ', u'How do we have a pro-urban agenda, how do we have the ability to address the challenges and abilities of our cities with a candidate who is the candidate from not-the-cities? ', u'The  big sort  has become a bigger sort, a bigger sort on steroids. ', u'The driving force of that is not just cultural preference, it s the fact that our economic centers of gravity are large cities and metropolitan areas. ', u'So if you want to pursue opportunity you move to where that opportunity is. ', u'It s great to evoke  move to another place,  but the centers of opportunity in the United States and in the world are incredibly clustered and concentrated. ', u'A third of the U.S. workforce are knowledge workers, professional workers, creative workers. ', u'That means 66 percent of the workforce is not. ', u'Blue-collar workers   the jobs aren t there anymore. ', u'Jobs are being eliminated. ', u'Our country is divided. ', u'It s horribly divided. ', u'Donald Trump ran on hardening those divisions.

', u'Don t get me wrong, there will be some migrations out of these urban cores, these superstar cities and tech hubs, because they are expensive.

', u'It s not a civil war in the military conflict sense, but we have a terribly divided country. ', u'It s not just divided by our ideology   it s divided by our class divisions and our locations. ', u'America has always been divided between rich and poor, now for much of our modern history we had a middle class, but one thing that s happened is not only has the middle class shrunk, but middle-class neighborhoods have been eviscerated.

[u'Former Cuban prisoner Alan Gross had some harsh words for Donald Trump Wednesday, telling Yahoo Global News Anchor Katie Couric that the president-elect is  a megalomaniac of the same ilk as Fidel Castro, only he s not as well read.

', u'He spoke to Couric about his hopes for the future of U.S. relations with the island nation, Castro s death and Trump. ', u'History will never absolve him. ', u'But perhaps now the voices of Cuba will be heard. ', u'Speak up, Cuba. ', u'Alan P. Gross (@AlanPGross) November 26, 2016 Though he said Trump s statement on the news of Castro s death last weekend was  absolutely right on target,  Gross said,  I do not think that the president of the United States should make that type of statement. ', u'Trump had condemned the  brutal dictator  for his long history of  fundamental human rights  violations.I', u'In contrast, Gross pointed to President Obama s far less critical comments as  the statement of a statesman. ', u'Gross s release from prison in 2014 was integral to Obama s effort to reopen U.S. diplomatic relations with Cuba, and he praised the president s executive action to ease restrictions on Cuban-Americans to travel and send money home to family on the island.T', u'There is a  direct and undeniable correlation between easing in restrictions in remittances   and growth in [Cuba s] private sector,  Gross said, insisting that the U.S. trade embargo, launched during the Cold War, was  only intended to be applied to government of Cuba,  which at the time had  decimated the private sector. ', u'He argued that the trade embargo should finally be lifted, and said it would  put enormous pressure on the government of Cuba because they will no longer be able to blame the bad guys in the north on their economic woes.

', u'But since then, Trump has not repeated that stance, and earlier this week he suggested that there was room for Cuba s government to negotiate with him: If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal. ', u'Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 28, 2016 Gross dismissed the threat from Trump. ', u'It s not rational for the future head of state to be tweeting unsubstantiated garbage,  he said.

[u"BOSTON (AP)   Changing marijuana laws aren't necessarily making weed more welcome in the workplace.F", u'For now, many employers appear to be sticking with their drug testing and personal conduct policies, even in states where recreational marijuana use is now permitted. ', u'Others are keeping a close eye on the still evolving legal, regulatory and political environment.V', u"Voters in California, Massachusetts, Maine and Nevada voted Nov. 8 to approve the use of recreational marijuana, joining Colorado, Washington, Oregon and Alaska, where it had previously been legalized. (A recount of Maine's close result is scheduled.) More than two dozen states have medical marijuana programs.B", u'But the drug is still against federal law.A', u'A closer look at what it all means for workers and businesses:___CAN MY EMPLOYER STILL TEST ME FOR POT?B', u"Bottom line: You can't come to work high. ", u'You can still be drug tested. ', u"And you can still be fired   or not hired   for failing a drug test even if you're not the least bit impaired at work.A", u'All the states with legalized recreational pot have exemptions for workplace drug policies.I', u'In Massachusetts, for example, the law includes language stating that "the authority of employers to enact and enforce workplace policies restricting the consumption of marijuana by employees" is not changed."', u'"Yes, you may be able to have (marijuana) at home, but that doesn\'t mean it\'s OK in the workplace," said Edward Yost, an HR specialist with the Society for Human Resources Management.___WHAT ABOUT WORKPLACE SAFETY?A', u'Advocates for marijuana legalization said it was never their intention to compromise safety, a central reason offered by employers for drug testing."', u'"We don\'t want anyone to come to work impaired on any drugs," said David Boyer, campaign manager for the ballot initiative in Maine.A', u'A 2013 survey by the employee screening firm HireRight found 78 percent of employers conducted drug tests either randomly, as a condition of employment, after accidents or for some combination of those reasons.T', u'The federal government requires drug testing for some workers, including truck drivers and others in transportation.Q', u'Quest Diagnostics, which performed nearly 11 million laboratory-based drug tests for employers in 2015, said the percentage of tests coming back positive has shown a modest increase in recent years. ', u'Nearly half of all positive tests showed evidence of marijuana use.___ C', u"CAN I GET FIRED EVEN IF I'M NOT HIGH? ", u"THC, the psychoactive chemical in cannabis, can stay in a person's system for days or even weeks, experts say   long after the buzz has subsided. ", u'"It\'s the equivalent of firing somebody who drank a glass of wine on Friday evening and then came to work on Monday," said Tamar Todd, legal director for the Drug Policy Alliance, who believes employers should reconsider zero-tolerance policies in light of changing laws and attitudes. ', u'A number of efforts are underway to develop an accurate method, akin to the Breathalyzer for alcohol, to measure actual marijuana impairment. ', u'Such a test might be useful not only for employers, but also for police and prosecutors trying to determine what constitutes driving under the influence of marijuana in states where recreational pot is legal. ___ W', u'WHAT SHOULD COMPANIES DO? ', u'At a minimum, companies should review their current polices, make sure their managers are trained and make clear to employees that marijuana use on or off the job can still land them in trouble, said James Reidy, a New Hampshire-based attorney who advises clients around the country on drug testing issues. ', u'Tina Sharby, chief human resources officer for an Easter Seals affiliate with about 1,700 employees in New England, said the organization, which provides services for people with special needs, is monitoring the evolving legal and regulatory environment but is sticking with its drug testing protocols for now. ', u'"We have a drug-free workplace policy, and we believe that the current policy we have is effective," Sharby said. ', u'But drug testing and zero-tolerance rules can also make it difficult for businesses with a need to recruit young professionals who may harbor more liberal attitudes toward pot. ', u'"We have ski industries out here, and if they really took a hard line on marijuana use, they would have to shut down," said Curtis Graves, information resource manager for the Colorado-based Mountain States Employers Council. ', u'After Colorado became the first state to legalize recreational marijuana in 2012, surveys showed an uptick in workplace drug testing, Graves said, but that trend has begun to shift in the other direction. ', u'"Employers who have a zero-tolerance policy maybe shouldn\'t apply that to non-safety sensitive workers, because if they do testing on them, they run the risk of inviting an invasion of privacy claim," suggested Amanda Baer, a Boston-area attorney who specializes in labor and employment issues. ___ W', u'WHAT DO THE COURTS SAY? ', u'Adding to the uncertainty is the scarcity of legal precedent in states that have legalized recreational marijuana. ', u"But several cases involving employees with permits to use medical marijuana have reached the courts, and most have been decided in employers' favor. ", u"The most widely cited case is a 2015 Colorado Supreme Court that upheld Dish Network's firing of a disabled man who used medical marijuana and failed a drug test. ", u'The court ruled that a state law barring employers from firing workers for off-duty behavior that is legal did not apply because pot remains illegal under federal law. ', u'Similar rulings have been issued in other states including California, Montana and Washington. ', u'As medical marijuana programs become more common even in states where recreational pot remains outlawed, some companies have begun to weigh accommodations for workers with permission to use marijuana for an existing health condition.']

[u'A Burmese python in the Everglades with a penchant for venison gulped down three whole deer   one doe and two fawns   before wildlife officials captured and euthanized it, a new study reveals.T', u"The gustatory feat sets a record: It's the first invasive Burmese python (Python molurus bivittatus) caught with three deer in its gut, said study co-lead author Scott Boback, an associate professor of biology at Dickinson College in Pennsylvania.T", u'The python probably attacked and ate the deer at different times over a 90-day period, Boback said.

[u'Even though Apple has long been one of the most successful, profitable and closely-observed tech companies on the planet, it s absolutely dumbfounding how often armchair pundits and analysts manage to get everything wrong about the company.

', u'These costs alone would represent 46 percent to 134 percent of DirecTV Now s $35 retail price, against which third parties will be competing for AT  Mobility customers, and would be borne in addition to all other costs of providing service by the unaffiliated provider.

[u'If you ve been considering cutting your cord in order to stick it to your cable company, you might be surprised by just how little that television service means to heavyweights like Comcast. ', u'One Wall Street analyst did the math and determined that sometimes slashing a cable subscription only costs the company a measly $5.50.T', u'Thanks to the bundling deals that cable companies like Comcast make oh so irresistible, analyst Craig Moffett argues that the actual TV portion of many cable bills is much smaller than it might seem.U', u'Using Comcast as an example, Moffett says that dropping TV initially costs the company about $38. ', u'However, because the bundling discount is eliminated by cutting the cable cord, the price of the high-speed internet service jumps up by another $25.S', u'Some customers, Moffett argues, also opt to increase their internet service speed in order to support the content streaming alternatives that are replacing their cable TV service, further increasing the price of their bill until it s virtually the same. ', u'A recent survey from Survata supports his assertion, finding that 49% of cable customers in the U.S. were willing to boost their internet speed in favor of dropping pay TV. ', u'Our survey found a reasonably robust willingness to pay for higher speeds in order to stream video, particularly among those contemplating cutting the cord,  Moffett said.T', u'The problem is further exacerbated by the fact that most cable companies hold monopolies over their respective markets.

[u'SALT LAKE CITY (AP)   A Utah mother and father who followed their son to school and pulled a shotgun from his hand after he fired a round into a classroom ceiling likely prevented bloodshed by acting quickly on their intuition and conversations with the boy after they noticed guns were missing from their home, police said Friday.T', u'The parents arrived shortly after the boy entered the classroom.

[u'A school district in Virginia temporarily suspended the use of two classic American novels after a concerned mother complained about the racial slurs in them.T', u'The novels in question are  To Kill a Mockingbird  by Harper Lee and  Adventures of Huckleberry Finn  by Mark Twain. ', u'Scholars hold both books in high regard for their literary merit and the anti-racist themes that were progressive for their respective eras.N', u'Nevertheless, both novels have been repeatedly challenged in school libraries over the years for the books  frequent use of the N word, which appears 219 times in  Huckleberry Finn  and 48 times in  To Kill a Mockingbird. ', u'Both books rank among the most banned and challenged in U.S. history.I', u'In the latest case, a parent of a child in Accomack County Public Schools filed a  Request for Reconsideration of Learning Resources  form challenging the use of both books in the school curriculum after speaking at a school board meeting last month, CBS affiliate WTVR reported Thursday.O', u'On Nov. 15, she told the school board that her child is biracial and that he s having trouble reading past one page that has the N word on it seven times. ', u'She suggested that the students read other books because assigning  Huckleberry Finn,  she argued,  validates that these words are acceptable. ', u'I keep hearing  This is a classic, this is a classic. ', u'I understand that   but at some point I feel the children do not truly get the classic part   but there are so much racial slurs in there and offensive wording that you can t get past that,  the mother can be heard saying in an audio recording of the meeting. ', u'Right now, our nation is divided as it is. ', u'I teach my son he is the best of both worlds, and I do not want him to feel otherwise. ', u'The superintendent for Accomack County Public Schools did not respond to a request for comment from Yahoo News.R', u'Roger Lathbury, a professor of English at George Mason University, said the N word was freely used in many 19th-century books and even in early 20th-century ones. ', u'That the word did not have the same racial charge in the 19th century, when Twain wrote, does not count for the banners,  he told Yahoo News on Friday. ', u'That partly is understandable, because grade school and high school students usually do not read with a sophisticated historical sense; on the other hand, it is simplistic thinking. ', u'Lathbury, who specializes in early American fiction and modern British poetry, pointed out that  Huckleberry Finn  was banned in Boston and elsewhere when it was first published in the U.S. in 1885 for reasons that had nothing to do with racial slurs. ', u'The reason was that Huckleberry Finn was judged to be too low-class for literature, too rough and uncivilized a person for readers to focus on,  he said. ', u'Of course, that is exactly Twain s point   to be  sivilized  is to be on the wrong side of human values   but the banners did not redline the book for that reason; they wanted a more acceptable hero, closer to Tom Sawyer. ', u'The American Library Association (ALA), a pro-library nonprofit that promotes freedom of expression, says books are usually challenged on the grounds of shielding children from sexual content or offensive language, which was the case in Accomack County.A', u'According to the ALA s  Library Bill of Rights,  librarians and governing bodies should respect that only parents have the right to restrict their own children s access to library resources. ', u'The organization maintains that libraries violate the First Amendment if they censor constitutionally protected speech.S', u'Some people have attempted to thread the needle on the controversy. ', u'In 2011, professor Alan Gribben sparked widespread controversy when he announced that he would publish expurgated versions of  Huckleberry Finn  and  The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,  another Twain book that uses the N word.I', u'In the forward to this edition, Gribben explained that he has given instruction on both books for nearly 40 years and would always recoil from uttering the racial epithet during his lessons. ', u'He started to substitute other words for the N word to the students  relief and wanted to provide an alternative edition for teachers who felt uncomfortable with the word but did not want to abandon Twain s masterpiece altogether. ', u'I invariably substituted the word  slave  for Twain s ubiquitous N word whenever I read any passages aloud,  he wrote. ', u'Students and audience members seemed to prefer this expedient, and I could detect a visible sense of relief each time, as though a nagging problem with the text had been addressed. ', u'Indeed, numerous communities currently ban Huckleberry Finn as required reading in public schools owing to its offensive racial language and have quietly moved the title to voluntary reading lists. ', u'The reaction was fiercely divided. ', u'Many argued that readers cannot fully comprehend the evils of slavery if texts that realistically depict the era are bowdlerized. ', u'But Gribben maintained that it is preferable to salvage the text, which is central to the history of American literature, than to have it banned in various public schools.A', u'After all, author Ernest Hemingway once famously said,  All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called  Huckleberry Finn. ', u'American writing comes from that. ', u'There was nothing before. ', u'There has been nothing as good since. ']

[u'RIO NEGRO, Colombia (AP)   Victims of this week\'s tragic air crash in the Andes were flown home Friday as Bolivia\'s president called for "drastic measures" against aviation officials who signed off on a flight plan that experts and even one of the charter airline\'s executives said should never have been attempted because of a possible fuel shortage.T', u'The move by President Evo Morales came after evidence emerged that the pilot reported the plane was out of fuel minutes before it slammed into a muddy mountainside, killing all but six of the 77 people on board.

[u"When South Korea's Park Geun-Hye looks back on the scandal-fuelled implosion of her presidency, she may reflect ruefully on what lit the first fuse -- a parent pulling strings over a child's education.P", u"Park's downfall was the result of her friendship with Choi Soon-Sil -- a secretive, long-time confidante who stands accused of meddling in state affairs, squeezing tens of millions of dollars from local companies and amassing a fortune by leveraging her ties to the president.I", u"It's a damning list of charges, but one that may never have come to light but for a fatal misstep by Choi two years ago in using her influence to secure her daughter's admission to an elite university.T", u'This was the first loose thread pulled at by investigators probing Choi, and one that swiftly unravelled the entire scandal that now looks set to cost Park her presidency.A', u"According to a formal audit, Choi's daughter, Chung Yoo-Ra, was given preferential treatment when applying to Ewha Womans' University in 2014 and was admitted at the expense of other candidates with better qualifications.A", u'As a student, she was given a perfect attendance record despite cutting some classes, and her high grades did not reflect her actual academic performance.I', u"In the light of the far more dramatic revelations that followed, Choi's string-pulling on her daughter's behalf might seem like a relatively minor infraction.- Sacred education -But while South Koreans have become resigned to a certain degree of corruption and influence-peddling, there are a few sacred cows that even the most powerful mess with at their peril -- and education tops the list.A", u"A rigorously meritocratic education system lies at the heart of South Korea's stellar rise from the ashes of the 1950-53 Korean War to Asia's fourth-largest economy.T", u'The system is highly competitive and can take a distressing toll on young students who devote their teenage years to studying for the national college entrance exam.A', u"Admission to one of a handful of elite universities -- such as Ewha -- is seen as vital to a student's future prosperity, social standing and even marriage prospects.B", u"But however cut-throat it might be, there is steadfast public faith and trust in the exam's fairness, with every applicant sitting the same paper on the same day, and a formalised marking system.T", u'That faith is summed up in a term popular for decades, "a dragon from a ditch" -- a person of modest means who rose to success through education and hard work.- Model \'dragons\' -Model "dragons" include former president Lee Myung-Bak, who worked as a garbageman to earn college tuition, and his predecessor Roh Moo-Hyun -- a poor farmer\'s son who self-studied to pass a bar exam."', u'"The long-held belief that even those who are poor and from a humble background can rise up the social ladder through education has been a major strength of our society," the daily Dong-A Ilbo said in a recent editorial."', u'"But Chung and Choi shattered this faith and hope spectacularly," it said.P', u"Park's presidency has coincided with growing disquiet over a widening disparity in incomes and opportunities -- an inequality now embodied in the public mind by Choi and her daughter. ", u'In a now-infamous Facebook posting in 2014, Chung flaunted her privilege, saying: "Money is part of your talent. If you don\'t have talent, blame your parents." T', u"The depth of anger over Chung's admission to Ewha has been illustrated by the large number of high-school students who have taken part in weekly mass demonstrations that have seen millions march through the streets of Seoul and other cities. ", u'"I was so angry about Chung and couldn\'t even sleep when I first heard about her scandal," said Jenny Park, a 16-year-old high school student. ', u'"What\'s the point of studying night and day when the rich and powerful can rig the whole system so easily?" she said, waving a banner reading "We didn\'t study hard for this." P', u"Prosecutors have accused Park Geun-Hye of colluding with Choi, and the president's approval rating among students -- and pretty much the entire under-40 demographic -- is currently close to zero. - Challenged youth - I", u"In many ways, young South Koreans face bigger challenges than their parents' generation who enjoyed ample and relatively equal opportunities during the rapid growth that peaked in the 1970s and 80s.

', u'"Given how this scandal unfolded, how can I can tell my 15-year-old daughter: \'study hard, then you can be successful?\'" office worker Kim Hwa-Young, 45, said at a recent anti-Park rally.

[u'OAKLAND, Calif.

We knew people were in there, and we were trying to get them out. But it was just a labyrinth," Oakland deputy fire chief Mark Hoffmann told reporters Saturday afternoon.H', u'He said that firefighters had to stop their search and rescue operation Saturday afternoon for safety reasons and shore up the structure, but they expected to resume later in the day.

[u'The popular AirDroid file-management app could open your Android device to attack, a security firm says. ', u'Until the flaw gets fixed   hopefully, within the next two weeks   you should stop using the app.R', u'Researchers at San Francisco mobile-security company Zimperium have discovered a flaw in AirDroid that allows malicious hackers to overcome encryption and access potentially sensitive information. ', u'The flaw can also give hackers the ability to remotely execute code on the respective device.A', u'According to Zimperium, which spoke to ArsTechnica about the flaw, AirDroid uses a static encryption key to safeguard some data transmitted by the app. ', u"What's worse, the researchers say, that encryption key can be easily found within the app's code by anyone with a even little know-how.A", u'Armed with that knowledge, a hacker can launch a man-in-the-middle attack on devices using AirDroid. ', u"From there, the hackers can decrypt the mobile app's communications and even get full remote control over the smartphone through a malicious software update. ", u'The hack can only occur if both the attacker and the targets are on the same Wi-Fi network.A', u'AirDroid, which was developed by Chinese company Sand Studio, is available in the Google Play marketplace for more than 30 countries. ', u'It lets users access and control their Android devices from the Web or on a PC or Mac. ', u'It also offers full backup and syncing of potentially private data such as photos and videos, and gives users access to SMS. ', u"The free-to-download app has been installed between 10 million and 50 million times, according to Google's own count on the Play marketplace.A", u'According to Zimperium, it initially contacted Sand Studio about the flaw on May 24 and attempted to follow up with the company for a few months after the disclosure. ', u'The security firm said in its blog post that it received a response from Sand Studio about an upcoming update, but as of the Nov. 28 release of AirDroid 4.0, the flaw was still present. ', u'A second update to AirDroid on Nov. 21 also left the vulnerability in place.A', u"After facing outcry from some of AirDroid's millions of users on Thursday, the company issued a blog post on Friday in hopes of quelling unrest and explaining next steps. ", u"Sand Studio says that the flaw cannot be exploited on a secure Wi-Fi network. (It's not clear if that's accurate.) The company then acknowledged that it hasn't yet updated the software, blaming the delay on coding complexities. ", u'The company added that it\'s been working "tirelessly" to fix the problem and says it hopes to have it fixed "within two weeks as planned."Still, the damage is done and AirDroid users are now at risk for at least another couple of weeks. ', u'To address that, Zimperium had some solutions, including telling users only to use HTTPS and additional encryption. ', u'The company also recommended users consider uninstalling AirDroid until a fix is available.S', u'See also :  25 Best Tech Products of 2016']

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   A presidential commission on Friday made 16 urgent recommendations to improve the nation's cybersecurity, including creating a nutritional-type label to help consumers shop wisely and appointing a new international ambassador on the subject   weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.T", u'The release of the 100-page report follows the worst hacking of U.S. government systems in history and accusations by the Obama administration that Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election by hacking Democrats.T', u'The Presidential Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity urged immediate action within two to five years and suggested the Trump administration consider acting on some proposals within its first 100 days.T', u'The commission recommended that Trump create an assistant to the president for cybersecurity, who would report through the national security adviser, and establish an ambassador for cybersecurity, who would lead efforts to create international rules. ', u"It urged steps, such as getting rid of traditional passwords, to end the threat of identity theft by 2021 and said Trump's administration should train 100,000 new cybersecurity workers by 2020.O", u'Other ideas included helping consumers to judge products using an independent nutritional-type label for technology products and services."', u'"What we\'ve been doing over the last 15 to 20 years simply isn\'t working, and the problem isn\'t going to be fixed simply by adding more money," said Steven Chabinsky, a commission member and the global chair of the data, privacy and cybersecurity practice for White & Case LLP, an international law firm.H', u'He said the group wanted the burden of cybersecurity "moved away from every computer user and handled at higher levels," including internet providers and product developers who could ensure security by default and design "for everyone\'s benefit."The White House requested the report in February and intended it to serve as a transition memo for the next president. ', u'The commission included 12 of what the White House described as the brightest minds in business, academia, technology and security. ', u"It was led by Tom Donilon, Obama's former national security adviser.T", u'The panel studied sharing information with private companies about cyber threats, the lack of talented American security engineers and distrust of the U.S. government by private businesses, especially in Silicon Valley.

", u'Trump won the election on promises to reduce government regulations, although decades of relying on market pressure or asking businesses to voluntarily make their products and services safer have been largely ineffective.T', u"Trump's presidential campaign benefited from embarrassing disclosures in hacked emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton's campaign staff and others, and Trump openly invited Russian hackers to find and release tens of thousands of personal emails that Clinton had deleted from the private server she had used to conduct government business as secretary of state. ", u"He also disputed the Obama administration's conclusion that Russia was responsible for the Democratic hackings.T", u'Though Trump is a prolific user of online social media services, especially Twitter, he is rarely seen using a computer.

', u'He said his team will develop mandatory cyber awareness training for all U.S. government employees, and he has proposed a buildup of U.S. military offensive and defensive cyber capabilities that he said will deter foreign hackers.T', u'The new report suggested that the government should remain the only organization responsible for responding to large-scale attacks by foreign countries.O', u'Obama has a mixed legacy on cybersecurity.U', u'Under Obama, hackers stole personal data from the U.S. ', u'Office of Personnel Management on more than 21 million current, former and prospective government employees, including details of security-clearance background investigations for federal agents, intelligence employees and others. ', u'The White House also failed in its efforts to convince Congress to pass a national law   similar to laws passed in some states   to require hacked companies to notify affected customers. ', u"But the Obama administration also became more aggressive about publicly identifying foreign governments it accused of hacking U.S. victims, arrested some high-profile hackers overseas, successfully shut down some large networks of hacked computers used to attack online targets, enacted but never actually used economic sanctions against countries that hacked American targets and used a sophisticated new cyberweapon called Stuxnet against Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities.

[u'Apple s decision to charge $19 for a charger and then $19 for a cable to plug in has had the effect you d expect on the world: everyone just buys knockoff chargers off Amazon instead.B', u'But although most chargers you buy off the internet will work just fine most of the time, a series of recent tests have shown that there s real danger to having a fake charger plugged in at home.T', u'The independent UL laboratory ran a series of basic electrical safety tests on fake chargers bought online from stores around the world. ', u'The results weren t good: of the 400 counterfeit Apple chargers purchased, 397 failed a basic safety test conducted by the UL laboratory:  In total, we tested 400 adapters and the results were literally shocking. ', u'The overall failure rate exceeded 99 percent. ', u'All but three failed our basic safety tests and were fire and shock hazards. ', u'Twelve were so poorly designed and constructed that they posed a risk of lethal electrocution to the user. ', u'So that doesn t mean the chargers will definitely shock you; rather, if a power surge hits your house, it s likely to fry your phone at best, or cause a fire at worst.T', u'This isn t some kind of impossible bogeyman, either. ', u'We see pictures all the time of people who have been burned by faulty batteries or chargers while charging their smartphones overnight, and the Galaxy Note 7 debacle is a good reminder of how much damage a low-voltage electrical device can do.T', u'The UK Trading Standards authority also examined second-hand chargers by looking in thrift stores and markets around London. ', u'Of 3,000 chargers tested, 15% were found to be unsafe in some way.

', u'To avoid buying a counterfeit charger or accessory, you might want to take a look at Apple s guide to spotting fake products. ', u'The company has an entire support page dedicated to telling the difference between fake cables and the real thing. ', u'It s also worth mentioning that there are two different standards to look for here. ', u'Apple produces and sells its own iPhone accessories, but it also certifies third-party accessories (although not the standard USB-to-Lightning cable!) under the  Made for iPhone  program. ', u'Under the terms of that agreement, manufacturers pay a licensing fee to Apple to use the Lightning port and Apple s proprietary design and circuitry. ', u'That makes accessories more expensive, but it also makes them far more likely to work correctly.T', u'The MFi logo should be found on the packaging of any officially certified accessory, like battery chargers, cases, docks or speakers   basically, anything that attaches to your iPhone. ', u'There s one exception to this, though   Apple doesn t certify any USB-C to Lightning cables, so any of those with an  Made for iPhone  logo is guaranteed to be fake.A', u'As for spotting counterfeit cables against the genuine Apple product, there s plenty of details on Apple s site.

[u'December is a great time to buy a new car as dealers have been dropping prices since September to make room for next year s models. ', u'But to get the best deal at the dealership, you have to play the game. ', u'To help you save the most money, check out some of my secrets to saving when buying a new car.#1 Do your homework First, before ever coming near a dealership, spend at least an hour online doing some homework. ', u'Edmunds.com and Kelley Blue book are great resources to find out the fair market range of the make and model you want. ', u'If you don t do this, you ll be walking in blindly and likely end up paying more than you need to.#2 Search for rebates You can search for available rebates on Edmunds.com site as well as directly on the car manufacturer s site. ', u'In addition to cash back, look for incentives like low-interest financing offers that are offered directly to shoppers.#3 Know the difference between the  MSRP  and  invoice  price To stay on budget, walk in knowing what your maximum purchase price can be. ', u'The manufacturer s suggested retail price, or MSRP, is what the dealers want you to pay. ', u'The invoice price is closer to what the dealer actually paid for the car. ', u'A fair price, or the fair market range, is just above the invoice price   and that s the number you want to keep in mind.#4 Don t forget about all the fees Buyer beware: your head can spin with the fees the salesmen throw your way. ', u'But not all of them are legit, warns Karl Brauer, executive publisher at Kelley Blue Book. ', u'The only real fees you cannot get out of are the taxes (based on the state you live in, not where you buy the car), the title and license/registration fees,  says Brauer. ', u'All the other fees, such as transportation fees, delivery fees, doc fees, and dealer prep fees, can be negotiated down to zero.O', u'One way to keep it simple and stay on budget is to ask for what insiders call the  out the door  price. ', u'This price includes all the fees on top of the car s base price   making it easier for you to calculate your monthly payments.#5 Print out all of the research Once you ve done your research, print out the information to take with you.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   A presidential commission on Friday made 16 urgent recommendations to improve the nation's cybersecurity, including creating a nutritional-type label to help consumers shop wisely and appointing a new international ambassador on the subject   weeks before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.T", u'The release of the 100-page report follows the worst hacking of U.S. government systems in history and accusations by the Obama administration that Russia meddled in the U.S. presidential election by hacking Democrats.T', u'The Presidential Commission on Enhancing National Cybersecurity urged immediate action within two to five years and suggested the Trump administration consider acting on some proposals within its first 100 days.T', u'The commission recommended that Trump create an assistant to the president for cybersecurity, who would report through the national security adviser, and establish an ambassador for cybersecurity, who would lead efforts to create international rules. ', u"It urged steps, such as getting rid of traditional passwords, to end the threat of identity theft by 2021 and said Trump's administration should train 100,000 new cybersecurity workers by 2020.O", u'Other ideas included helping consumers to judge products using an independent nutritional-type label for technology products and services."', u'"What we\'ve been doing over the last 15 to 20 years simply isn\'t working, and the problem isn\'t going to be fixed simply by adding more money," said Steven Chabinsky, a commission member and the global chair of the data, privacy and cybersecurity practice for White & Case LLP, an international law firm.H', u'He said the group wanted the burden of cybersecurity "moved away from every computer user and handled at higher levels," including internet providers and product developers who could ensure security by default and design "for everyone\'s benefit."The White House requested the report in February and intended it to serve as a transition memo for the next president. ', u'The commission included 12 of what the White House described as the brightest minds in business, academia, technology and security. ', u"It was led by Tom Donilon, Obama's former national security adviser.T", u'The panel studied sharing information with private companies about cyber threats, the lack of talented American security engineers and distrust of the U.S. government by private businesses, especially in Silicon Valley. ', u'Classified documents stolen under Obama by Edward Snowden, a contractor for the National Security Agency, revealed government efforts to hack into the data pipelines used by U.S. companies to serve customers overseas.O', u'One commissioner, Herbert Lin of Stanford University, said some senior information technology managers distrust the federal government as much as they distrust China, widely regarded as actively hacking in the U.S.P', u'President Barack Obama said in a written statement after meeting with Donilon that his administration will take additional action "wherever possible" to build on its efforts make progress before he leaves office next month. ', u'He urged Trump and the next Congress to treat the recommendations as a guide."', u'"Now it is time for the next administration to take up this charge and ensure that cyberspace can continue to be the driver for prosperity, innovation, and change both in the United States and around the world," Obama said.I', u"It was not immediately clear whether Trump would accept the group's recommendations. ", u'Trump won the election on promises to reduce government regulations, although decades of relying on market pressure or asking businesses to voluntarily make their products and services safer have been largely ineffective.T', u"Trump's presidential campaign benefited from embarrassing disclosures in hacked emails stolen from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton's campaign staff and others, and Trump openly invited Russian hackers to find and release tens of thousands of personal emails that Clinton had deleted from the private server she had used to conduct government business as secretary of state. ", u"He also disputed the Obama administration's conclusion that Russia was responsible for the Democratic hackings.T", u'Though Trump is a prolific user of online social media services, especially Twitter, he is rarely seen using a computer. ', u'His campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, tweeted a photograph Monday of Trump working on an Apple laptop inside his office at Trump Tower. ', u'He testified in a deposition in 2012 that he did not own a personal computer or smartphone, and in another deposition earlier this year said he deliberately does not use email.T', u'Trump has already promised his own study by a "Cyber Review Team" of people he said he will select from military, law enforcement and private sectors. ', u'He said his team will develop mandatory cyber awareness training for all U.S. government employees, and he has proposed a buildup of U.S. military offensive and defensive cyber capabilities that he said will deter foreign hackers.T', u'The new report suggested that the government should remain the only organization responsible for responding to large-scale attacks by foreign countries.O', u'Obama has a mixed legacy on cybersecurity.U', u'Under Obama, hackers stole personal data from the U.S. ', u'Office of Personnel Management on more than 21 million current, former and prospective government employees, including details of security-clearance background investigations for federal agents, intelligence employees and others. ', u'The White House also failed in its efforts to convince Congress to pass a national law   similar to laws passed in some states   to require hacked companies to notify affected customers. ', u"But the Obama administration also became more aggressive about publicly identifying foreign governments it accused of hacking U.S. victims, arrested some high-profile hackers overseas, successfully shut down some large networks of hacked computers used to attack online targets, enacted but never actually used economic sanctions against countries that hacked American targets and used a sophisticated new cyber weapon called Stuxnet against Iran's main nuclear enrichment facilities. ", u'Congress passed a new law in late 2015 to encourage companies and the government to share information about online threats. ___ F', u'Follow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams ___ C', u'Copy of the report: https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2016/12/02/cybersecurity-commission-report-final-post.pdf']

[u"Vienna (AFP) - Austria's Norbert Hofer, who swiftly conceded defeat in an election Sunday in which he was bidding to become the EU's first far-right president, is an ideologue and no fan of the bloc.T", u'The mild-mannered 45-year-old, a gun enthusiast who has walked with a cane since a 2003 paraglider accident, is a key figure in the anti-immigration Freedom Party (FPOe).I', u"It was Hofer, together with chief FPOe strategist Herbert Kickl, who persuaded party leader Heinz-Christian Strache to tone down the party's often aggressive anti-foreigner message and to focus on issues like inequality too.T", u'Together with a savvy use of the internet, the strategy paid off. ', u'The FPOe is currently scoring over 30 percent in polls ahead of the next general election, scheduled for 2018, with voters deserting the more mainstream parties.I', u'It also helped Hofer -- with the slogan "unspoilt, honest, good" -- top the presidential election first round in April with 35 percent and knock out the two government-backed candidates.I', u'In a runoff against independent ecologist Alexander Van der Bellen in May, he lost by just 31,000 votes. ', u"But the FPOe cried foul, securing this Sunday's re-run because of irregularities.T", u"The aeronautical engineer turned politician, a father-of-four, was born into a middle-class family as the son of a local councillor from the centre-right People's Party.H", u"He joined the FPOe's local branch in 1994 and became party secretary two years later, before turning close advisor to Strache, successor to the controversial Joerg Haider.- Protect the borders -Immigration was not a major issue in Hofer's campaign. ", u'Instead he focused on themes like wanting more Swiss-style direct democracy and economic reforms.W', u'While data show his core support to be among working class men without a school diploma, and in rural areas, he has also won backing right across Austrian society.B', u'But despite the softer image, the FPOe remains the natural party for the considerable section of society uncomfortable with globalisation and issues like gay marriage and, most of all, immigrants.H', u'Hofer pandered to this, albeit mostly in moderate tones, calling for Austria\'s borders to be "protected" and warning against the "dangers of a wrong immigration policy".I', u'Islam "has no place in Austria" since it poses a danger to the country\'s Judeo-Christian and humanist values, he told a young Austrian Muslim on a talk show in May.U', u'Unguarded comments also show a sharper side. ', u'Van der Bellen is a "communist", he said on November 11, and no Muslims work in caring for the elderly -- both claims wildly inaccurate.H', u'He is an honorary member of a pan-Germanic student fraternity that according to its founding charter rejects the "historically incorrect fiction of an \'Austrian nation\'".H', u'Hofer, like other FPOe members, has also on occasion worn a cornflower, used by banned Austrian Nazis in the 1930s to identify each other. ', u"He insists it's for the pretty blue, the FPOe's colours.A", u'And while Hofer may strike a more moderate tone, his party does not. ', u'Strache recently called German Chancellor Angela Merkel "the most dangerous woman in Europe" and warned of impending "civil war".A', u"Analyst Thomas Hofer said that he had toned down the party's message because the FPOe's base was not enough to win over enough voters to win the presidency. ", u"But don't be fooled, he said. ", u'"He is the one who is responsible for the current FPOe programme. Of course he has the same policy issues as... Strache," the expert told AFP. - \'Europe of fatherlands\' - H', u'Hofer was also deeply critical of the European Union, at least in its current "centralised" form. ', u'"If Austria wasn\'t a member and wanted to join, I would vote \'No\'," he has said. ', u'He wants a "Europe of fatherlands" and a referendum on Austria\'s EU membership -- if Turkey joins the bloc or if Brussels takes too much power from member states. ', u"Since 1945, Austria's president has performed a largely ceremonial role, but the constitution gives the head of state considerable powers -- untapped so far -- including to fire the government. ", u'"You\'ll be amazed what\'s possible," Hofer said in April, a comment he later disavowed but which his opponents have made much of. ', u'Now Austria will never know what he meant.']

[u'Beijing (AFP) - China protested to Washington Saturday after US President-elect Donald Trump broke with decades of foreign policy and spoke with the president of Taiwan.I', u'It was not immediately clear whether Trump\'s telephone call with Tsai Ing-wen marked a deliberate pivot away from Washington\'s official "One China" stance, but it fuelled fears he is improvising on international affairs.C', u"China regards self-ruling Taiwan as part of its own territory awaiting reunification under Beijing's rule, and any US move that would imply support for independence would likely trigger fury.D", u'During Friday\'s discussion, Trump and Tsai noted "the close economic, political and security ties" between Taiwan and the United States, according to the president-elect\'s office."', u'"President-elect Trump also congratulated President Tsai on becoming President of Taiwan earlier this year," it said.B', u'Beijing on Saturday offered a robust response."', u'"We have already made solemn representations about it to the relevant US side," the Chinese foreign ministry said."', u'"It must be pointed out that there is only one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China\'s territory,"China also urged "relevant parties in the US... to handle Taiwan-related issues with caution and care to avoid unnecessarily interfering with the overall situation of Sino-US relations."Trump, who had come under fire for the telephone call, hit back -- on Twitter."', u'"Interesting how the U.S. sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call," Trump tweeted.- \'How wars start\' -President Barack Obama\'s White House said the outgoing US administration had not changed its stance on China-Taiwan issues."', u'"There is no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues," National Security Council spokeswoman Emily Horne told reporters."', u'"We remain firmly committed to our \'One China\' policy," she added.

[u'After the election of Donald Trump and the Brexit vote to leave the European Union, Italy could become the stage for the latest populist uprising against the established political order.

', u'Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has staked his political future on the outcome of the vote, vowing to resign if his proposals do not win a majority support. ', u'In power since 2014, Renzi, of the center-left Democratic Party, wants to streamline the legislative system, reducing the number of senators and reducing the power of the Senate.T', u'The exact changes are detailed and complex, but they would move Italy away from a perfect bicameral system, in which the Chamber of Deputies and the upper Senate are roughly equal. ', u'Renzi has argued that such a move is necessary in order for him to get on with the task of reviving the country s struggling economy.H', u'However, the proposals are highly controversial. ', u'They would change a constitution drawn up in 1947 in the wake of the rule of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini. ', u'Many are wary of any changes that help concentrate political power in the hands of the executive branch.T', u'The reforms passed through parliament in April, but failed to get the two-thirds support required to avoid them having to go before a referendum. ', u'Opinion polls suggest Renzi is struggling to make his case to the people.I', u'In the final polls before an official blackout on Nov. 18, the  No  camp was in front with 53.5 percent support. ', u'The betting markets also believe a  No  vote is likely, giving it 3/10 odds of coming out on top, equal to 77 percent. ', u'The  Yes  vote was at 9/4, equivalent to 31 percent.E', u'Everything has still been up for grabs in the final two weeks of the campaign, with 20 percent of people still indicating they were undecided. ', u'Yet the situation was not looking good for Renzi, or potentially the eurozone. ', u'Even before the vote, markets have displayed their jitteriness about the outcome. ', u'The euro was at one point down as much as 0.3 percent against the dollar on Friday, while Europe s FTSEurofirst 300 index dropped 0.16 percent.A', u'A  No  vote would fuel further instability. ', u'If Renzi resigns, President Sergio Mattarella could appoint another prime minister. ', u'In that event, any appointee would likely struggle to win parliamentary support, meaning early elections in 2017 could well be called.I', u'If that does happen, then it could bring to power Italy s own anti-establishment movement. ', u'The Five Star Movement (MS5) has been the most vocal advocate for a  No  vote in the referendum and a victory for its cause on Sunday would likely signal a fresh spike in its popularity. ', u'MS5 led Renzi s Democratic Party in the polls this summer and in the most recent polls was trailing by only a point at around 30 percent.L', u'Led by comedian Beppe Grillo, the Five Star Movement has vowed that if it wins power it will hold a referendum on whether Italy should leave the eurozone. ', u'With Italy housing the eurozone s third-largest economy, there are fears that the whole currency would then collapse.A', u'Although a strong majority of Italians currently indicate they are in favor of remaining part of the euro, nothing will be taken for granted after Britain s shock vote to leave the EU in June.R', u'Related Articles']

[u'As part of its App Store policy, Apple can choose to give refunds to customers who are unsatisfied with an app they download.

', u'It determines whether to give refunds to consumers. ', u'But the content developer cannot take part in the process under Apple s refund policy. ', u'Apple does not even provide information about the users who have requested and received the refund, claiming it is to protect consumer rights. ', u'For this reason, the developers have no other choice but to manually track down the users and check if they continue to use the charged content they have already received refunds for. ', u'On the backdrop of this, some users have abused the loophole in Apple s refund policy to purchase charged content multiple times, request refunds and continue to consume the content without actually paying for it. ', u'In particular, some of the abusers have organized profitable businesses to operate the refund process on others  behalf. ', u'If the game studios alleging abuse of Apple s policies are right, this is a serious problem.

', u'But with no help from Apple, it s a long and difficult struggle for the developers.

[u'We re still waiting for an official verdict from Samsung over what caused the Galaxy Note 7 debacle. ', u'Given that the company got it wrong the first time it recalled its flagship smartphone, you can excuse it for taking its time to investigate things.B', u'But Samsung s ongoing investigation hasn t stopped one engineering firm from finding a Galaxy Note 7, setting up a couple fire extinguishers, and tearing the phone down to do its own analysis.I', u'Instrumental is a manufacturing technology firm that realized the void of information on the Galaxy Note 7 recall made for a perfect PR opportunity. ', u'The company s engineers tore down the phone to expose the battery in between, and then wrote a blog post analyzing the (many) design problems with the battery:  What we found was surprising: the design can compress the battery even during normal operation (see footnote). ', u'Why does this matter? ', u'The Note 7 s lithium-polymer battery is a flattened  jelly-roll  consisting of a positive layer made of lithium cobalt oxide, a negative layer made of graphite, and two electrolyte-soaked separator layers made of polymer. ', u'The separator layers allow ions (and energy) to flow between the positive and negative layers, without allowing those layers to touch. ', u'If the positive and negative layers ever do touch, the energy flowing goes directly into the electrolyte, heating it, which causes more energy to flow and more heat   it typically results in an explosion. ', u'Compressing the battery puts pressure on those critical polymer separator layers that keep the battery safe. ', u'In short, there s two design problems here: the battery is too susceptible to a small amount of pressure, and there wasn t enough tolerance around the battery in the phone, so regular use caused the rest of the phone to compress the battery.I', u'Instrumental also hints that Samsung engineers were probably aware of the fine line they were walking from the start. ', u'The battery rests in a custom CNC enclosure, an unusual and costly design choice that s made to protect the battery from the rest of the phone. ', u'Only, it didn t work.A', u'Another interesting observation from the teardown is that even if the Note 7 hadn t had an explosion problem, customers might have seen bad long-term effects, the same sort of problems that have plagued the iPhone 6 Plus and  Touchgate :  If the Galaxy Note 7 wasn t recalled for exploding batteries, Sam and I believe that a few years down the road these phones would be slowly pushed apart by mechanical battery swell. ', u'A smaller battery using standard manufacturing parameters would have solved the explosion issue and the swell issue. ', u'But, a smaller battery would have reduced the system s battery life below the level of its predecessor, the Note 5, as well as its biggest competitor, the iPhone 7 Plus. ', u'The conclusion from the teardown probably won t shock anyone: in the hunt to make the Galaxy Note 7 the best phone on the market, Samsung s engineers flew too close to the sun. ', u'It wasn t some critical mistake that sunk the Note 7, just engineering tolerances being pushed to the limit.T', u'Trending right now:']

', u'They ll also cost a minimum of $300, which is a hard sell when the cheapest Echo hardware is $30.P', u'People don t want a PC sitting in their kitchen.

[u'By Ronnie Cohen(Reuters Health) - Poverty cuts an average of almost 10 years off American men s lives and seven off women s, a new study shows.E', u'Eager to tease out socioeconomic disparities that can hide in state-level data, researchers reclassified all the U.S. counties into 50 new  states  based on household income instead of geography. ', u'Then they examined longevity, smoking, obesity, childhood poverty and other health information from the richest and poorest places.M', u'Men in the poorest spots died on average nearly 10 years earlier, at 69 years old, than men in the wealthiest ones, and women in the poorest places died on average seven years sooner, at 76 years old, the research team reports in the American Journal of Public Health. ', u'The results should be deeply disturbing to all persons in the country,  the study authors write. ', u'Life expectancy in the poorest  state  falls below that of more than half the countries in the world, meaning that, in essence, there are several developing countries hidden within the borders of the United States. ', u'Senior author Dr. Randy Wykoff said in a phone interview that he expected to see differences in smoking and obesity rates   and that s indeed what the study showed. ', u'Adults in the poorest places were twice as likely to smoke and 50 percent more likely to be obese.B', u'But the life-expectancy gap surprised him, said Wykoff, who is dean of the College of Public Health at East Tennessee State University in Johnson City.A', u'Also stark were the numbers about race and children living in poverty.N', u'Non-Hispanic African-Americans were 4.5 times more likely to live in the poorest regions than in the richest, the study found. ', u'Also, more than 48 percent of children in the poorest spots lived below the federal poverty line, while less than 9 percent of children in the wealthiest did. ', u'Nearly half of young children grow up in low-income families that cannot provide them with adequate resources to thrive,  Dr. Neal Halfon wrote in an email addressing the study.H', u'Halfon directs the Center for Healthier Children, Families and Communities at the University of California, Los Angeles. ', u'He was not involved in the research. ', u'It is not hard to see that individuals born in these low-income and deprived places with few resources are likely to have much lower lifelong health trajectories,  he said. ', u'The public sector and civic sector have not been able to put together a comprehensive anti-poverty campaign.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   President-elect Donald Trump suggested Tuesday that he would cancel Boeing's contract to build a new fleet of presidential aircraft to replace the aging models that shuttle the president around the world. ", u'He cited "out of control" costs of more than $4 billion in a tweet that ended with "Cancel order!"The New York businessman, who flies on his own Boeing plane, later told reporters the cost to the government was "ridiculous," though he appeared to be citing more than just the bare acquisition costs. ', u'Trump said he wanted the aircraft manufacturer to make money, "but not that much."Here\'s a look at Trump\'s claims about Air Force One, one of the most recognized symbols of the American presidency.___HOW MUCH WILL THE PROJECT COST?T', u"The Government Accountability Office, the government's auditing arm, in March of this year estimated total program costs at more than $3.2 billion, much of it for research and development, through the 2020 federal budget year. ", u"Separately, Defense Department and Air Force officials put the cost for two new aircraft at around Trump's figure of $4 billion. ", u'That estimate includes the cost of research and development, construction and future maintenance, according to the officials who were not authorized to comment publicly about the sensitive military project and spoke on condition of anonymity.___WHY DOES THE GOVERNMENT WANT NEW PLANES? ', u"DOESN'T THE CURRENT AIR FORCE ONE WORK JUST FINE?T", u"That's true, but the two modified Boeing 747s the president uses for the bulk of his travels are getting older and breaking down more often, officials say. ", u'They were built in the 1980s and began flying in the early 1990s. ', u'One flew President Barack Obama to MacDill Air Force in Tampa, Florida, on Tuesday.T', u'The distinctive blue-and-white plane with the U.S. flag on its tail and the presidential seal on its belly is basically a flying office for the president, complete with sophisticated communications, military and other capabilities. ', u'Safety of the president is paramount, and the government started the process to replace the aging aircraft with younger versions that incorporate updated capabilities and technological advances.A', u'Air Force One is unlike most aircraft. ', u'It can be refueled in the air and, with an unlimited range, can take the president wherever he needs to go. ', u'Its electrical systems are hardened to protect against an electromagnetic pulse, and the plane has advanced, secure communications equipment that will allow it to function as mobile command center in the event of an attack on the United States, according to the White House.T', u'The president and most of those who fly with him enjoy 4,000 square feet of floor space on three levels, including a suite for the president with an office and a conference room. ', u'A medical suite can function as an operating room in an emergency, and a doctor is always on board. ', u"The plane has quarters for those who regularly accompany the president on trips, including White House staff, Secret Service agents, traveling journalists and other guests.___WHAT IS BOEING'S ROLE?T", u'The Air Force has spent about $170 million on three contracts to begin to identify the types of military and specialized systems that would have to be added to a commercial plane to adapt it for use by the president. ', u'Boeing has that contract, and also would build the replacement Air Force One.U', u'Under the deal, the Air Force would buy the 747-8 aircraft, a newer version of those currently in use as Air Force One. ', u"The new aircraft wouldn't be ready until around 2023 or 2024, the end of Trump's second term, should he seek and win re-election.I", u'In a statement, Boeing said it looks forward to working with the Air Force "to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer."___COULD TRUMP ASK ANOTHER COMPANY TO BUILD THE NEW AIRCRAFT? ', u"It's unclear. ", u'Trump did not elaborate, either on Twitter or during a brief appearance before reporters Tuesday. ', u'Presidents have flown on Boeing aircraft for more than seven decades and the Chicago-based company is the only American maker of these types of planes. ', u'Its closest rival would be French aircraft manufacturer Airbus. ___ D', u"DIDN'T OBAMA CANCEL THE CONTRACT FOR A NEW PRESIDENTIAL HELICOPTER? ", u"Earnest, the White House spokesman, said Obama didn't scrap the project entirely, but ordered the military to restart it to bring the cost projections under control. ", u'The Marine One project was further along in the process than the Air Force One upgrade, and with costs much greater than originally expected. ___ C', u'CAN TRUMP CANCEL THE PROJECT? ', u'Yes, but not before he is sworn in to office on Jan. 20. ___ A', u'Associated Press writers Lolita C. Baldor in Washington, David Koenig in Dallas and Joseph Pisani in New York contributed to this report.']

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.T', u"The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices.C", u"Cupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.T", u'The case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. ', u'Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.A', u'At issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay "total profit." Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.J', u'Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. ', u'The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.B', u'But the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. ', u'Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.S', u'Samsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. ', u"Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.S", u'Samsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. ', u'None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.I', u'In a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts "will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\'t right.""Our case has always been about Samsung\'s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute," the company said. ', u'"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world\'s most innovative and beloved product."Samsung in a statement called the ruling a victory "for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace."The patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. ', u'Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.O', u'On the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage "design pirates" and protect companies that invest in creative designs."', u'"This removes a threat for technology companies," said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law.

[u'TAMPA, Fla. (AP)   Closing out two terms as a president at war, Barack Obama staunchly defended his counterterrorism strategy as one that rejected torture, held to American values and avoided large-scale troop deployments, in an implicit effort to shape the strategy his successor might employ.O', u'Obama came to MacDill Air Force Base, home to U.S. ', u'Special Operations Command and Central Command, to give his final speech on national security. ', u'He delivered a strident argument for his reliance on drone strikes and U.S. commandos rather than ground wars like those launched in Iraq and Afghanistan by his predecessor. ', u'Obama emphasized the need for the U.S. to uphold its values by respecting the rights of Muslims and trying terror suspects in civilian courts."', u'"We can get these terrorists and stay true to who we are," Obama said."', u'"Rather than offer false promises that we can eliminate terrorism by dropping more bombs, or deploying more and more troops, or by fencing ourselves off from the rest of the world, we have to take a long view of the terrorist threat," Obama told troops gathered in an airplane hangar. ', u'"We have to pursue a smart strategy that can be sustained."In describing the nature of the threat after eight years of his leadership, Obama sought to strike a careful balance, arguing at once that "violent extremism will be with us for years to come" and that terrorists "don\'t pose an existential threat" to the U.S. ', u'He said unlike previous wars against other nations, it was unlikely this conflict would end with a "clearly defined victory."Though White House officials said the speech was planned before Donald Trump was elected, Obama\'s remarks were clearly tailored to address some of Trump\'s proposals.I', u"In a warning that appeared aimed at Trump, who has called for barring Muslim immigrants temporarily, Obama said the U.S. doesn't impose religious tests. ", u'He forcefully defended his decision to bar the use of torture against detainees while chastising Congress for refusing to let him shutter the Guantanamo Bay detention center, which Obama called a "blot on our national honor."Amnesty International USA urged the incoming commander in chief to heed Obama\'s advice, arguing that the speech "offers lessons for Trump."Obama acknowledged he wasn\'t entirely successful in what he has described as his push to take the U.S. off its wartime footing. ', u'He has been forced to rely on more than 15-year-old law, passed by Congress after 9/11, as the legal underpinning for his campaign against the Islamic State group, but pointed the finger at Congress for failing to update it."', u'"Democracies should not operate in a state of permanently authorized war," Obama said.T', u'Trump has said little about how he intends to combat extremist groups, arguing that ambiguity and unpredictability are assets that deny the enemy a chance to plan ahead. ', u"Still, all signs suggest he'll pursue a more muscular, military-driven approach, including his selection of hawkish aides for his team such as retired Gen. Michael T. Flynn for national security adviser.T", u"The president-elect has argued that Obama's decision to withdraw the bulk of troops from Iraq created a power vacuum that allowed IS to form and seize territory. ", u'Obama said that was because Baghdad refused to sign a pact granting legal protections to U.S. troops to stay, though officials have acknowledged privately over the years that Obama never forcefully pushed for such a deal.O', u'Obama came into office telling a war-weary nation he would wind down two wars and prevent new ones. ', u'Obama said his use of drones, for example, had saved civilian lives, arguing that airstrikes would have been less precise and ground troops more deadly."', u'"You have to weigh the alternatives," Obama said.B', u"But Obama's approach most notably came up short in Syria, where Obama long ago predicted that Syrian President Bashar Assad would lose his grip on power. ", u"But Assad's control appears stronger than it has in years while the brutal civil war rages on.W", u"While U.S. troop casualties declined significantly under Obama's approach, the U.S. is now fighting in far more corners of the globe, which Obama attributed to a metastasizing extremist threat.T", u'The U.S. is currently launching strikes in Syria, Somalia, Libya and Yemen, according to a report to Congress the White House released this week. ', u'Additional U.S. troops and assets are also in Jordan, Djibouti, Turkey, Egypt and Cameroon to support counterterrorism missions, while other overseas operations remain classified.M', u'Much of the counterterrorism mission is being carried out not by traditional ground troops who have traditionally done most of the fighting in U.S. wars, but by commandos like the Army Delta Force and Navy SEALs. ', u"Their agility, advanced training and light footprint make them attractive for fighting in places where the U.S. doesn't want to get bogged down.B", u'Before taking the stage for his speech, Obama met with top military leaders at the base, including Gen. Raymond Thomas, who heads U.S. ', u'Special Operations Command. ', u'He also told troops serving at the base that it had been the privilege of his lifetime to serve as their commander in chief.']

[u'It s already been two months since a number of Galaxy Note 7 units started catching fire, and now it looks like one of the major reasons why it happened was due to Samsung s flawed design. ', u'Manufacturing company Instrumental tore down the handset and discovered that it may have been too thin for the battery.T', u'The lithium-polymer battery inside the Galaxy Note 7 is flattened inside. ', u'But what s more interesting to point out here is that the battery compresses inside the device even during normal operation. ', u'The Note 7 s lithium-polymer battery is a flattened  jelly-roll  consisting of a positive layer made of lithium cobalt oxide, a negative layer made of graphite and two electrolyte-soaked separator layers made of polymer,  as explained by Instrumental. ', u'The separator layers allow ions (and energy) to flow between the positive and negative layers, without allowing those layers to touch. ', u'If the positive and negative layers ever do touch, the energy flowing goes directly into the electrolyte, heating it, which causes more energy to flow and more heat -- it typically results in an explosion. ', u'To put it simply, the battery inside the Galaxy Note 7 didn t have enough room inside the very thin device. ', u'The battery doesn t have enough space inside for when it naturally swells while being used. ', u'The compression risked the chemicals inside the battery to come into contact with each other which can cause an explosion, according to Business Insider.I', u'Instrumental s solution to this problem is to simply put a smaller battery inside the Note 7. ', u'This would give it more room when the battery naturally swells inside the device while being used. ', u'Unfortunately, this also meant that a smaller battery will make the battery life of the Note 7 shorter.B', u'Battery life is, of course, one of the major factors in buying a handset, and it appears as though Samsung was unwilling to compromise that. ', u'Reducing the battery size would also mean that it would have a battery life that s shorter than its predecessor, the Note 5, and its biggest rival, the iPhone 7 Plus.I', u'Instrumental s discovery is just one take on the issue, and it s possible that it s not the only reason why the Galaxy Note 7 kept on catching fire.

[u"Washington (AFP) - The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million patent infringement penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple's iPhone design, in a case watched for its implications for technology innovation.T", u'The shorthanded justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court.W', u'While the ruling was short on specifics, analysts said it was likely to curb litigation from patent holders expecting to reap big profits from infringement on a component.T', u'The 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty -- one element of a major patent infringement case -- was inappropriate because it represented "Samsung\'s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones" for copying the iPhone\'s "rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen."But the court stopped short of delving into details of how the lower court should determine the penalty.J', u'Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion that "doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture... and to parse the record to apply that test in this case."The court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details.T', u'The case is one element of the $548 million penalty -- knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award -- Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents.- No clarity -Observers had been watching to see how the court -- which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century -- would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property.D', u'Dennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed."', u'"Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law," Crouch said in a blog post.C', u'Crouch said the court allowed for damages at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is "an article of manufacture," leaving the matter open to interpretation."', u'"Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level (of damages) applies in particular cases," he wrote.S', u'Samsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation.A', u'Apple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. ', u"Design professionals, researchers and academics, citing precedents like Coca-Cola's iconic soda bottle.R", u'Reacting to the verdict, an Apple spokesman said in an email, "Our case has always been about Samsung\'s blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute... We remain optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn\'t right."Samsung did not immediately respond to requests for comment.- \'Sigh of relief\' - F', u'Florian Mueller, an intellectual property analyst who writes a closely followed patent blog, wrote that "large parts of the (US and global) tech industry will breathe a sigh of relief now," even if the case is not settled. ', u'Ed Black, president of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, which represents major tech firms, welcomed the ruling. ', u'"This was a pivotal court case for the technology industry and it is encouraging to see the law interpreted and applied in a way that makes sense in a modern era and protects both inventors and innovation," Black said. ', u'The lower court\'s interpretation of design patents, Black said, "would have had a chilling effect on investment and the development of products -- especially in the tech sector." B', u'Brian Love, a law professor who follows technology at the University of Santa Clara, said it was noteworthy that the top court declined to provide detailed guidance on how to resolve the damage award. ', u'"The district court may well end up allowing the entire amount to stand, but it seems more likely that the award will be substantially reduced," Love said. ', u'Still, Love said it may dissuade companies from launching new lawsuits on design patents. ', u'"Interest in design patents spiked following Apple\'s first jury verdict in 2012," he said. ', u'"Companies suddenly saw design patent rights as a potential gold mine. Now, it seems likely that assertion of design patents will return to being a rare occurrence."']

[u'LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP)   Crew fatigue brought on by irregular work schedules and a moderate form of sleep apnea is the primary reason behind a middle-of-the-night train crash that killed two Union Pacific workers and injured two others in northern Arkansas, the National Transportation Safety Board said Tuesday.T', u"The panel also blamed an automatic horn that improperly reset alarms and the railroad industry's slow adoption of a system to stop trains automatically.T", u'The conductor and engineer killed in the crash were likely sleeping in their southbound train as it sped through a stop signal Aug. 17, 2014, and hit a northbound Union Pacific train, the board found."', u'"This tragedy illustrates what can happen when identified weaknesses in safety protection are not addressed," NTSB Chairman Christopher Hart said to open Tuesday\'s hearing. ', u'"The crew of the train did not stop or slow their train in response to three restrictive signals. This action is indicative of fatigue, a problem that occurs so regularly it is on the most-wanted list of transportation safety improvements."The railroad said Tuesday it extends condolences to the families of conductor Roderick Hayes of McKinney, Texas, and engineer Chance Gober of White Hall, Arkansas, amid thoughts of the two injured workers from the northbound train."', u'"Safety is Union Pacific\'s top priority and we look forward to examining the NTSB\'s recommendations," spokesman Jeff DeGraff said in an emailed statement.I', u'Investigators found that, as the train approached Hoxie, a town of 2,700 near the Missouri border, the southbound crew activated an automatic horn that repeats blasts in a long-long-short-long sequence until being shut off. ', u'As each cycle started anew, it reset a device designed to ensure the crew is alert. ', u"Had it worked properly, the engineer and conductor would have been warned at least three times that something wasn't right. ", u"If they didn't respond to the warnings, the train would have applied its brakes automatically.T", u'The investigators also found that either the conductor or the engineer disengaged the horn 44 seconds before the crash, but the board\'s medical officer said it was likely just as a reflex."', u'"Have you ever hit the alarm, the snooze button on your alarm clock?" Dr. Mary Pat McKay told the board. ', u'"Automated responses can happen when you are not awake. We can explain the turning off of the horn."The conductor had worked an irregular schedule ahead of his final trip while the engineer had moderate sleep apnea that he was not required to report. ', u'Union Pacific required that only severe cases be disclosed.A', u'After its 3-1 vote on the cause of the 2014 accident, the board unanimously recommended that railroads and government agencies screen for sleep apnea among transportation workers, citing its increasing role in accidents.T', u'The condition has been implicated in a September crash in northern New Jersey that killed one person and a 2013 crash in the Bronx on the Metro-North Railroad Hudson Line that killed four. ', u'Crew fatigue was a factor in fatal train collisions in Red Oak, Iowa, in 2011, and Newton, Massachusetts, in 2008.T', u'The board also renewed its call for "positive train control," which uses GPS-based technology to monitor and control train movement.N', u'NTSB vice chairman T. Bella Dinh-Zarr voted against the findings. ', u'She said that since the board has been advocating for a form of positive train control since 1970, it deserved greater attention so "there aren\'t catastrophic results because of one simple human mistake."Most railroads face a December 2018 deadline to install the technology.___Follow Kelly P.

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.T', u'The new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital "fingerprints" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.T', u'The move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns   and derail proposed new federal legislation   over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.T', u'Technical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. ', u"Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.S", u'Social media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. ', u'Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from "flash to bang"   or radicalization to violence   with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.U', u'Under the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves "the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services   content most likely to violate all our respective companies\' content policies," according to a joint announcement Monday evening.W', u'When such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. ', u'If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.M', u'Most social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. ', u'Twitter, for example, says users "may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.""We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online   that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies," said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.T', u'The White House praised the joint effort. ', u'"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online," said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. ', u'"Today\'s announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended."The new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media\'s use by terrorist groups.L', u'Lawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement.

', u"A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.F", u'Facebook found the post   which was under an alias   the day after the attack. ', u'The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. ', u'Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.T', u'Twitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified "proprietary spam-fighting tools" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. ', u'The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled."', u'"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter\'s policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism," said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter\'s vice president of public policy. ', u'"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools."Facebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it\'s already removed. ', u'The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.T', u'Terrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter.

[u'It was dusk on Monday, Sept. 3, 1827, when the party from South Carolina drew up at the Hermitage, Andrew Jackson s plantation near Nashville. ', u'One of the travelers, a young woman named Julia Ann Conner, left a diary account of her surprise at finding that Jackson, whom she had expected to be a wild backwoodsman with a dictatorial bent that led his opponents to call him an American Bonaparte, was in fact nothing of the sort. ', u'He was, she recorded, a  venerable, dignified, fine-looking man, perfectly easy in manner. ', u'The Hermitage was filled with history. ', u'A brace of pistols that the Marquis de Lafayette had given to George Washington were on the mantelpiece, a gift to Jackson from the Washington family. ', u'They are preserved with almost sacred veneration,  as was a small pocket spyglass of the first President s, Conner wrote. ', u'And most important, the visitor benefited from her host s help during a game of chess. ', u'An  excellent player,  Jackson  frequently directed my moves apparently much interested in the fate of the game   there were no traces of the  military chieftain  as he is called! ', u'This sketch of Jackson the tactician a player of chess, a game that rewards careful thought and foresight explains much about his character. ', u'He could at times seem reckless, but more often he played the games of politics and war with skill and patience. ', u'And Conner was surely right when she observed that Old Hickory was  much interested in the fate of the game  he was always interested in the fate of the game, or of the battle, or of the vote. ', u'She had detected something deep and fundamental about Jackson in her days under his roof: he was more than a frontier politician or a mindless populist rabble rouser. ', u'His enemies and much of posterity never quite understood that the largest fact about Jackson was not a problem with his  passions  (or temper, in contemporary terms) but his ability, more often than not, to govern them and harness the energies that would have driven other political figures to ruin.W', u'With Donald Trump s rise to power as America s 45th President, those in search of an illuminating analogy have frequently cited the example of the seventh. ', u'Steve Bannon, now Trump s senior White House strategist, has made this explicit, arguing that the Trump revolution is akin to Jackson s populist insurgency in the 1820s and  30s. ', u'There are, of course, surface similarities. ', u'Both movements gained popularity based on freeing the country from established, ossified interests with a promise to return the nation to greatness (in Trump s formulation) or to Jeffersonian republican simplicity (in Jackson s). ', u'Both startled the existing order (the Clintons and the mainstream media in Trump s case; John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay in Jackson s). ', u'And both had powerful personalities at the head of the ticket.T', u'There is, however, an essential difference, one that will tell us much about the coming years in U.S. life and politics. ', u'For all his bombast, Jackson was an experienced public figure he had served as a judge, a Senator and a general who understood his weaknesses and took care to compensate for them. ', u'He could thunder and storm; he was prone to fits of rage and temper. ', u'Yet he was self-aware, and with that came a kind of self-restraint. ', u'He was, as his visitor to the Hermitage noted, as at home with a chessboard as he was with charging blindly forward. ', u'We simply don t yet know whether Trump possesses the kind of discipline that Jackson brought to the presidency.J', u'Jackson s character and worldview reflected a genuine conviction in the ultimate wisdom of the people. ', u'He was no opportunist. ', u'He came to his populism not as a political device but as a result of his experience. ', u'Born at the lower end of white colonial society he never knew his father, who died before he was born Jackson had been orphaned during the Revolution yet rose through force of will and a good marriage to the slave-owning planter class. ', u'A self-made man, he saw his political mission in stark terms: to remove what he believed to be corrupting influences (the Second Bank of the United States, entrenched federal appointees, monied speculators) so that ordinary Americans what he called  the planter, the farmer, the mechanic and the laborer  could rise to prosperity.J', u'Jackson could be woefully wrong. ', u'He was an unapologetic defender of slavery and the main architect of Native American removal. (Even before he was President, his many Indian wars destroyed much of tribal culture in a headlong grab for land.) In each of these instances, he was largely a creature of his time and place. ', u'This is not to excuse his culpability in the twin American sins of slavery and removal. ', u'It is to say, though, that history requires us to judge the figures of the past not by our own moral standards but by those of the ages in which they lived and worked.Y', u'Yet the Jackson example also offers us a way of assessing the moral climate and stakes of our own time. ', u'If generations past could get things so badly wrong, then we are forever vulnerable as well, and the moral utility of history may well lie in its capacity to remind ourselves that we are always at risk of falling short in the unending search to perfect the Union. ', u'That was true in the age of Jackson, and it is surely true in the age of Trump.F', u'For another lesson of Andrew Jackson is that we have only ourselves to blame or to credit. ', u'Great is the confidence which he has always reposed in the discernment and equity of the American people,  Senator Thomas Hart Benton said in summing up Jackson s presidency. ', u'I have been accustomed to see him for many years, and under many discouraging trials; but never saw him doubt, for an instant, the ultimate support of the people   He always said the people would stand by those who stand by them. ', u'Such is the covenant of democracies and the fate of that democracy lies both in the hands of the people and of the President. ', u'And now it is President Trump s move.']

[u'When AT  first took the wraps off of NumberSync in 2015, T-Mobile was quick to dismiss the solution, which allows AT  subscribers to use their mobile numbers for calling and texting on any compatible tablet or wearable. ', u'What we are working on will make this version one offering from AT  look small,  T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert said in an interview at the time. ', u'NumberSync ended up being well-received by subscribers following its release, and T-Mobile went silent for more than a year.N', u'Now, 14 months later, T-Mobile has finally unveiled  Digits,  the carrier s response to AT  s NumberSync solution.T', u'T-Mobile on Wednesday took the wraps off of a new service that mixes a handful of features we ve seen for years with a handful of firsts. ', u'Like Google Voice and NumberSync, Digits allows a T-Mobile number to work across multiple devices, including other smartphones, tablets, wearables and even Windows and Mac computers thanks to a browser-based app. ', u'T-Mobile s solution then extends further, mixing in temporary phone numbers, shared phone numbers, and call forwarding features that allow users to support multiple phone numbers on one smartphone. ', u'This way, a user can receive calls made to a mobile number, a work number and even a home number all on one device.M', u'More than 30 million Americans carry multiple devices, according to T-Mobile, and the carrier sees Digits as a way to eliminate the need for separate smartphones for personal and work use. ', u'Phones today are nothing like they were just a decade ago, but the phone number has basically stayed the same forever. ', u'It s time to shake things up,  T-Mobile CEO John Legere said of the new service. ', u'DIGITS works just like your T-Mobile phone number, except it is way more powerful. ', u'DIGITS works across virtually ALL your devices, and those devices can have multiple numbers on them. ', u'And this is my favorite part: you can even use DIGITS on Verizon, AT  and other smartphones! ', u'That final note is particularly interesting.W', u'While Digits is a network-level solution that is currently integrated into several phones including the Galaxy Note 5, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 edge, T-Mobile also provides Android and iOS apps that can be installed on any device from any carrier. ', u'Using this Digits app, people can make and receive calls using their T-Mobile number from smartphones on any other network. ', u'Of note, the Digits app for Apple s iPhone isn t a typical over-the-top app. ', u'Instead, it uses Apple s Phone APIs to integrate more deeply with the platform and fully integrate into the dialer, offering carrier-grade voice quality.T', u'T-Mobile s Digits is indeed the first time a carrier has offered a network-integrated solution that combines multi-number support on a smartphone with a portability solution that works across smartphones, tablets, wearables and computers. ', u'There are currently ways to achieve similar end results by piecing together multiple solutions, but none that offer carrier-grade calling as opposed to the lower quality one would experience with an over-the-top VoIP solution.A', u'According to T-Mobile COO Mike Sievert, the same exec who called AT  s NumberSync solution  small  when it was first announced, no other carrier will be able to offer a similar solution anytime soon. ', u'Simply put, DIGITS is breakthrough technology that won t be replicated any time soon,  Sievert said. ', u'This isn t the first time you can add extra numbers to a device, but this IS the first time you can do it all   multiple numbers on one device and one number on multiple devices   and do it with carrier-grade quality. ', u'DIGITS is your real T-Mobile number with every bit of the reliability, call prioritization, services and mobility you expect. ', u'In another first, Digits also marks the first time a major US wireless carrier has launched a wide-scale beta of this size. ', u'The carrier insists that its new solution is ready to scale, but it is making it available initially through a limited beta rather than launching it to all subscribers. ', u'In a phone interview, a T-Mobile spokesperson assured BGR that the beta will be available to any an all subscribers who sign up in the coming days, so eager T-Mobile users shouldn t worry about being locked out.T', u'T-Mobile told BGR that it is aiming to exit the free beta period and fully launch Digits early next year, and pricing hasn t yet been announced. ', u'In the meantime, subscribers can sign up to join the beta on T-Mobile s special Digits page.A', u'A video from T-Mobile detailing Digits is embedded below.T', u'Trending right now:']

[u' DETROIT (AP) -- A federal judge who ordered Michigan to begin its recount effectively ended it on Wednesday, tying his decision to a state court ruling that found Green Party candidate Jill Stein had no legal standing to request another look at ballots. ', u"The ruling seals Republican Donald Trump's narrow victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton for Michigan's 16 electoral votes. ", u'District Judge Mark Goldsmith agreed with Republicans who argued that the three-day recount must end a day after the state appeals court dealt a blow to the effort. ', u'The court said Stein, who finished fourth in Michigan on Nov. 8, didn\'t have a chance of winning even after a recount and therefore isn\'t an "aggrieved" candidate. ', u'"Because there is no basis for this court to ignore the Michigan court\'s ruling and make an independent judgment regarding what the Michigan Legislature intended by the term \'aggrieved,\' plaintiffs have not shown an entitlement to a recount," Goldsmith said. ', u"It was the judge's midnight ruling Monday that started the recount in Michigan. ", u"But Goldsmith's order dealt with timing   not whether a recount was appropriate. ", u'More than 20 of 83 counties already were counting ballots again. ', u"They reported minor changes in vote totals, although many precincts couldn't be examined for a second time for a variety of reasons. ", u'Earlier Wednesday, the Michigan elections board voted, 3-1, to end the recount if Goldsmith extinguished his earlier order. ', u"State Republican Party Chairman Ronna Romney McDaniel and Attorney General Bill Schuette said it's a victory for voters and taxpayers. ", u'Stein now is left with asking the Michigan Supreme Court to intervene, which is a long shot. ', u'"Jill Stein, who received only 1.07% of the vote in Michigan, is not legally entitled to hijack the will of voters and drag them into an arduous and expensive publicity stunt," McDaniel said. ', u"Stein got about 1 percent of the vote in three states where she's pushed for recounts   Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. ", u'Trump narrowly won all three. ', u'She insists she\'s more concerned about the accuracy of the election, but Goldsmith said Stein\'s legal team presented only "speculative claims" about vulnerable machines, "not actual injury."  ', u'The judge said a recount to test the integrity of the voting system "has never been endorsed by any court."  ', u'A court hearing will be held Friday on a possible recount in Pennsylvania. ', u"Wisconsin's recount, which started last week, has increased Trump's margin of victory over Clinton thus far.

[u'In 1959, Glenn wrote in Life magazine: "Space travel is at the frontier of my profession. It is going to be accomplished, and I want to be in on it.

[u'Talk versus action: It s always important to distinguish between the two especially with incoming president Donald Trump, a master of using hyperbole to get what he wants.T', u'Trump bashed China during the presidential campaign, and since winning the election on Nov. 8, he has continued to say he ll impose sanctions on China if it doesn t agree to more favorable trade terms. ', u'But those are mere words, and Trump just made an actual decision involving China that undercuts many of his threats.T', u'Trump has nominated Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad to be his ambassador to China, and by extension, point man for any new negotiations involving trade. ', u'CEOs who have been worried abut possible trade wars with China ought to cheer, because Branstad is steeped in the importance of trade and the ways it benefits Americans.B', u'Branstad has personally known Chinese president Xi Jinping since the 1980s, when the two men met through a cultural exchange. ', u'They have stayed in touch, with Xi visiting Iowa and Branstad being Xi s guest in China. ', u'A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman called Brandstad an  old friend  of China when the Trump news broke.B', u'But more important than Brandstad s personal connections in China is his understanding of the importance of trade. ', u'Exports account for 12% of Iowa s economic output and 22% of its jobs, according to the Asia Society. ', u'China is the state s third-largest trading partner, after Canada and Mexico. ', u'Corn is Iowa s biggest export, followed by tractors, other agricultural products and aircraft parts.T', u'Trump has said he ll impose tariffs of 35% or more on Chinese imports if China doesn t agree to trade reforms that, so far, Trump hasn t specified. ', u'Many trade experts feel China and other economic partners would retaliate with like measures if Trump tries to punish China. ', u'That kind of tit-for-tat would raise the cost of products imported from China, and reduce sales of American products to China.B', u'Branstad, as ambassador, would be the field general executing the orders of his boss in the White House. ', u'Trade tensions would harm farmers and businesses in Brandstad s home state. ', u'That doesn t mean it won t happen, but it means a key player would have to answer to real people he knows who would be harmed by tariffs and other punitive measures. ', u'While meant to punish China, they d also punish some ordinary Americans.M', u'Many analysts consider Trump s rhetorical excesses unhinged or mercurial. ', u'But a kind of logic is emerging. ', u'Trump makes threats as an opening negotiating bid. ', u'Then he settles for less. ', u'He bashed Carrier, for instance, for its plan to move 2,000 jobs from Indiana to Mexico, then declared victory when he persuaded the company to keep half those jobs in the United States.I', u'It s not hard to discern a similar pattern in Trump s approach toward China. ', u'His opening bid is a disruption of the status quo and the possibility of trade restrictions that could undermine the rapid economic growth China needs. ', u'He broke with decades of diplomatic protocol by having a breezy chat with the president of Taiwan, thumbing his nose at China s insistence that the democratic island nation is really a Chinese province.Y', u'Yet the man appointed to execute Trump s actual policy is a free trader who understands and respects Chinese sensibilities, and has benefited himself from open borders. ', u'Branstad is the good cop while Trump himself is the bad. ', u'The ambassador s main job will probably be finding a way for Trump to claim a win on trade, while leaving mostly everything else alone.R', u'Rick Newman is the author of four books, including Rebounders: How Winners Pivot from Setback to Success.

[u'By Ahmed Rasheed, Saif Hameed and Isabel ColesBAGHDAD/MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi troops who briefly seized a Mosul hospital believed to be used as an Islamic State base were forced to withdraw from the site, but managed to establish a base for army tanks nearby after days of fierce back-and-forth fighting, residents said.T', u'The rapid advance into the Wahda neighborhood where the hospital is located marked a change of tactic after a month of fighting in east Mosul in which the army has sought to capture and clear neighborhoods block by block.T', u"The ferocity of the fighting reflects the importance of the army's push from southeast Mosul towards the center, their deepest advance in a grueling seven-week offensive to crush Islamic State in Iraq's largest northern city.T", u'The soldiers seized Salam hospital, less than a mile (just over 1 km) from the Tigris river running through central Mosul, on Tuesday but pulled back the next day after they were attacked by six suicide car bombs and "heavy enemy fire", according to a statement by the U.S.-led coalition supporting Iraqi forces.C', u"Coalition warplanes, at Iraq's request, also struck a building inside the hospital complex from which the militants were firing machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades, it said.T", u"The soldiers involved in the action are at the spearhead of a U.S.-backed, 100,000-strong coalition of Iraqi forces including the army, federal police, Kurdish peshmerga fighters and mainly Shi'ite Popular Mobilization forces battling to crush Islamic State in Mosul.I", u'In another part of Mosul already recaptured by government troops, Iraqi police fired shots in the air and threatened to whip crowds with a hose as residents tried to overrun the first distribution of aid by UN agencies inside the city.T', u'The distribution aimed to reach 45,000 people in total at several locations.

[u'NEW YORK (AP)   A decades-long trend of rising life expectancy in the U.S. could be ending: It declined last year and it is no better than it was four years ago. ', u'In most of the years since World War II, life expectancy in the U.S. has inched up, thanks to medical advances, public health campaigns and better nutrition and education.B', u'But last year it slipped, an exceedingly rare event in a year that did not include a major disease outbreak. ', u'Other one-year declines occurred in 1993, when the nation was in the throes of the AIDS epidemic, and 1980, the result of an especially nasty flu season.I', u'In 2015, rates for 8 of the 10 leading causes of death rose. ', u'Even more troubling to health experts: the U.S. seems to be settling into a trend of no improvement at all."', u'"With four years, you\'re starting to see some indication of something a little more ominous," said S. Jay Olshansky, a University of Illinois-Chicago public health researcher.A', u'An American born in 2015 is expected to live 78 years and 9  months, on average, according to preliminary data released Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ', u'An American born in 2014 could expect to live about month longer, and even an American born in 2012 would have been expected to live slightly longer. ', u'In 1950, life expectancy was just over 68 years.T', u'The United States ranks below dozens of other high-income countries in life expectancy, according to the World Bank. ', u'It is highest in Japan, at nearly 84 years.T', u'The CDC report is based mainly on 2015 death certificates. ', u'There were more than 2.7 million deaths, or about 86,000 more than the previous year. ', u"The increase in raw numbers partly reflects the nation's growing and aging population.I", u"It was led by an unusual upturn in the death rate from the nation's leading killer, heart disease. ", u"Death rates also increased for chronic lower lung disease, accidental injuries, stroke, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, kidney disease and suicide.T", u"The only clear drop was in cancer, the nation's No. 2 killer.E", u"Experts aren't sure what's behind the stall. ", u'Some, like Olshansky, suspect obesity, an underlying factor in some of the largest causes of death, particularly heart disease.B', u"But there's also the impact of rising drug overdoses and suicides, he noted. ", u'"There are a lot of things happening at the same time," he said.S', u'Some years the CDC later revises its life expectancy estimate after doing additional analysis, including for its 2014 estimate.A', u'Average life expectancy declined for men, falling by more than two months, to 76 years and 3   months in 2015. ', u'It fell by about one month for women, to 81 years and 2   months, the CDC said.D', u'Death rates increased for black men, white men, white women, and slightly for Hispanic men and women. ', u'But they did not change for black women.T', u'The new CDC report did not offer a geographic breakdown of 2015 deaths, or analysis of death based on education or income. ', u'But other research has shown death rates are rising sharply for poorer people   particularly white people   in rural areas but not wealthier and more highly educated and people on the coasts."', u'"The troubling trends are most pronounced for the people who are the most disadvantaged," said Jennifer Karas Montez, a Syracuse University researcher who studies adult death patterns."', u'"But if we don\'t know why life expectancy is decreasing for some groups, we can\'t be confident that it won\'t start declining for others," she said.']

[u'Environmental advocates say they are shocked and worried after Donald Trump announced Thursday that he had selected Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt, who has denied mainstream climate science, to administer his Environmental Protection Agency. ', u'This is a full-fledged environmental emergency,  Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said in a conference call hours after Trump s announcement. ', u'This is going to be a litmus test for every member of the Senate who claims not to be a denier. ', u'Schatz, as well as Sens. ', u'Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I', u'I., and Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., called for their fellow senators to reject Pruitt s appointment, citing his climate skepticism and close ties to the oil and gas industry.M', u'Merkley encouraged elected officials and grassroots advocates to create a  wave of opposition  to stop Pruitt from ever being confirmed to head the EPA, which he said might as well be renamed the  Environmental Polluter Agency  under his leadership. ', u'This is a period where there are a lot of dark storm clouds and we are going to be called upon to work vigorously to block a lot of bad things from happening,  Merkley said.A', u'According to the Trump team, Pruitt, 48, is dedicated to rescinding all of Obama s  job-destroying executive actions  and eliminating barriers to  responsible energy production. ', u'A press release from the transition called him  a national leader against the EPA s job-killing war on coal. ', u'The pick was widely seen as confirmation that Trump intended to follow through on his campaign rhetoric of slashing federal regulations to empower coal mining, oil drilling and the fossil fuel industry, in general. ', u'For too long, the Environmental Protection Agency has spent taxpayer dollars on an out-of-control anti-energy agenda that has destroyed millions of jobs, while also undermining our incredible farmers and many other businesses and industries at every turn,  Trump said in a statement.P', u'Pruitt has spent much of his time as Oklahoma s top prosecutor fighting the agency he s set to be tasked with running. ', u'He repeatedly sued the EPA for   from his perspective   overstepping its bounds with federal regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power stations. ', u'His nomination is widely seen as an attack on President Obama s environmental legacy.P', u'Pruitt has claimed that the scientific debate over climate change is  far from settled. ', u'Scientists continue to disagree about the degree and extent of global warming and its connection to the actions of mankind,  he wrote in the National Review in May.S', u'Schatz characterized Pruitt as a professional climate-change denier who s made a career out of undermining the Clean Water Act of 1972 and the Clean Air Act of 1963. ', u'He said he s optimistic that Pruitt s nomination can be stopped because the  clean energy revolution  has taken ahold of red states, as well as blue and purple states. ', u'This is a four-alarm fire. ', u'We are going to do everything we can to stop his nomination. ', u'And we re going to need broad-based bipartisan support for that,  Schatz said. ', u'We re going to make our case and we re going to fight this with everything we ve got. ', u'Whitehouse further argued that Pruitt s nomination runs absolutely contrary to Trump s professed strategy of  draining the swamp. ', u'This is like filling up the swamp with one of the most determined and aggressive advocates for the fossil fuel industry,  he said.G', u'Gene Karpinski, the president of the League of Conservation Voters, a leading environmental organization, said Pruitt would be by far the worst administrator in the EPA s history. ', u'He said Pruitt s appointment would be a classic example of  the fox guarding the henhouse. ', u'Pruitt takes the polluters money and he does their bidding. ', u'He s against clean air. ', u'He s against clean water. ', u'He s unfit for this job and he should be rejected,  Karpinski said.T', u'Trump s victory against heavily favored Democrat Hillary Clinton was deeply troubling for the environmentalist and scientific communities. ', u'He has vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris Agreement and repeatedly dismissed climate change as a hoax. ', u'But he has also flip-flopped or appeared malleable on many issues, leaving a potential window of hope for environmentalists like Karpinski. ', u'I suppose you could say hope springs eternal and his comments in the New York Times interview perhaps suggested there was a possibility he d be different,  Karpinski told Yahoo News on the conference call. ', u'But [based on] everything he s said and done in the campaign, it was very clear where he was going to land. ', u'And this decision really underscores what he really cares about when it comes to clean air, clean water, public health. ']

[u'A bipartisan initiative to create learning standards for American school kids is creating an unlikely resistance to two of President-elect Donald Trump s Cabinet choices: Betsy DeVos for education secretary and his potential pick of Rex Tillerson for state.N', u'Notably, the right-wing news site Breitbart, which was until recently run by Trump s top adviser Stephen Bannon, ran a story over the weekend calling out Tillerson for his past support for Common Core. ', u'Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil, is the current frontrunner to become secretary of state, according to a flurry of reports over the weekend.B', u'Breitbart dug up the oil magnate s 2013 Wall Street Journal op-ed calling Common Core, an initiative launched by the National Governors Association, a  path to renewed competitiveness  for the U.S. ', u'Tillerson has a history of supporting policies opposite to many of the themes the president-elect highlighted during his campaign, including on Common Core education standards,  Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle wrote.O', u'Opposing Common Core was one of the few education issues Trump consistently touted on the campaign trail.

', u'Many homeschool advocates in particular are vehemently opposed to the standards.B', u'But Tillerson argued that Common Core would help the American workforce learn crucial math and technology skills they are currently lacking. ', u'He chided his home state of Texas for refusing to join the 45 states that adopted the Common Core standards in a speech in 2014. ', u'Tillerson said he was  extraordinarily disappointed  in Texas for refusing to adopt the standards.

Tom Corbett for delaying the implementation of the program in his state in 2013.C', u'Common Core may matter to many of Trump s supporters, but it s unlikely to be an issue in Tillerson s Senate confirmation.

[u"By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is stacking his trade transition team with veterans of the U.S. steel industry's battles with China, signaling a potentially more aggressive approach to U.S. complaints of unfair Chinese subsidies for its exports and barriers to imports.L", u"Led by Wilbur Ross, a billionaire steel investor and Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, Dan DiMicco, the former CEO of steelmaker Nucor Corp, and three veteran steel trade lawyers, the team is expected to help shift the U.S. trade focus more heavily toward enforcement actions aimed at bringing down a chronic U.S. trade deficit, Washington trade experts said. ", u"Based on their past efforts, this could include more challenges to China's trade practices through the World Trade Organization and more U.S. government-initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against a wider range of Chinese products. ", u'The latter would be argued before the U.S. ', u'International Trade Commission - a forum where the steel industry has had considerable success.R', u"Ross, DiMicco and other leaders of Big Steel have been on the front-line in U.S. trade battles against the world's export superpower.H", u'Lawyers Robert Lighthizer and Jeffrey Gerrish have represented United States Steel and Stephen Vaughn has represented AK Steel in these cases.

', u'PUSHING WTO LIMITS"Bob Lighthizer is very smart, very strategic and totally fearless," said a Washington attorney who has worked with him for three decades and asked not to be named because Trump\'s USTR selection process was still under way. ', u"Ross, who advised Trump's presidential campaign on economic issues, has signaled he will use access to the lucrative U.S. consumer market as leverage to negotiate better trade terms. ", u"The United States is China's biggest export market. ", u'During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to levy a punitive 45-percent tariff on Chinese goods and label Beijing a currency manipulator. ', u'It is not clear though whether he will follow through on those threats once he takes office. ', u'Ross told CNN last week that Trump will not be "willy nilly slapping a 45 percent tariff on everything," but will maintain the threat of tariffs as part of negotiations. ', u'In an emailed statement to Reuters, Ross said he would divest "all holdings and board seats that pose conflicts" but declined to answer other questions on his plans for Trump\'s trade policy and engagement with China. ', u'The personal blog of DiMicco, meanwhile, gives some indication of how he would approach China if he was named head of USTR. ', u'He has accused China of waging a "mercantilist trade war" on the United States for two decades, through currency manipulation, unfair subsidies and intellectual property theft. ', u"On the issue of currency manipulation, many economists disagree, saying Beijing is no longer keeping its yuan artificially undervalued to make its exports cheap, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves it has spent to prop up the yuan's value this year. ", u"A key question for Trump's trade team is how far they can push China to change its trade practices without provoking a trade war that will hurt both countries. ", u'"If what they plan to do is get a little scratchier with China on enforcement within the existing WTO rules, that\'s OK," said Scott Miller, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ', u'"But if they go outside those guardrails, it will be unpleasant because that will draw retaliation." H', u'He Weiwen, vice president at the Center for China and Globalization, a government-affiliated think-tank in Beijing, said any punitive action against China by the Trump administration would invite a retaliatory response. ', u'"We will certainly respond in the same way," he said, adding that Washington and Beijing "should find good solutions that are acceptable to both and not go to extremes. It will hurt both." C', u'Chinese state media have warned that any new tariffs imposed by Trump would lead to retaliation against Boeing aircraft, Apple iPhones and U.S. corn and soybeans.

[u'Later in the year, Obama delivered a speech in Cairo to offer the Muslim world  a new beginning  in ties with Washington, a fresh relationship  based on mutual interest and mutual respect. ', u'The subtext of the speech was that Obama was not George W. Bush, who had seen U.S. relations with the region largely through the prism of the global war on terrorism he declared after 9/11   including the 2003 invasion of Iraq.N', u'Now, seven years later, relations with the region are transformed, but not because of Obama s outreach. ', u'The tumultuous  Arab Spring  of 2011 toppled some of the region s strongmen. ', u'Libya s Moammar Gadhafi is gone, pushed out by rebels aided by the United States and its NATO partners. ', u'Protesters ousted Egypt s Hosni Mubarak, a crucial U.S. ally for decades, and the latest Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, has cracked down on dissent and nongovernmental organizations. ', u'Obama takes frequent criticism for not doing more to stop Syria s bloody civil war, with a death toll of as many as 400,000. ', u'After withdrawing U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011   a step he still regards as a legacy-defining achievement   Obama hurried thousands back to counter the rise of the so-called Islamic State. ', u'And Middle East peace seems as far away as ever. ', u'We d hoped to get further toward overcoming the history of the Israel-Palestinian conflict,  Rhodes told Yahoo News.B', u'But Obama seems to have pushed past history in the U.S. relationship with Cuba. ', u'The president and his Cuban counterpart, Ra l Castro, stunned the world in December 2014 by announcing that they had agreed after months of secret talks to work toward closer relations. ', u'But Obama had worked for years to ease U.S. pressure off Havana, making it easier for Cuban-Americans to send money to relatives on the island and visit them, for example.R', u'Rhodes, one of the key U.S. negotiators with Havana, said  part of what the president instructed me to say was,  We re not going to be bound by this past Cold War standoff, or grudge, where our relationship is just a recitation of a series of grievances in each direction. ', u'It s not clear whether President-elect Donald Trump will roll back Obama s outreach   reversing executive actions that made it easier for Americans to travel to Cuba, spend money there, and return with cigars and rum. ', u'The entrepreneur recently said he would  terminate  the deal unless the government in Havana undertakes unspecified steps to benefit its people and those in the U.S. ', u'Obama aides say they think they have created enough opportunities for U.S. businesses and American visitors in Cuba that the deal may be  irreversible. ', u'Republicans have portrayed the arrangement as Obama making concessions   giving the Castro regime access to foreign currency it needs to buy imports   without getting anything by way of democratic reforms in return. ', u'They note that most tourism earnings land in the military s pockets.O', u'Obama aides argue that Cuban entrepreneurs are benefiting from the arrangement, which boosts the island s new restaurateurs, cabdrivers and those who make their homes available to visitors on Airbnb. ', u'And Obama s team says the six-decade U.S. embargo, which Obama cannot lift without congressional action, only served to give the Castro regime a scapegoat for economic hardships.T', u'The recent death of Fidel Castro has highlighted another aspect of Obama s softer approach with Havana. ', u'Some U.S. officials say privately that a big part of the strategy has to do with reassuring Cubans that the island has a post-Castro economic future. ', u'Cubans without any prospects might decide to chance coming to the United States, where the Florida coast is just 90 miles away, rather than face a potentially chaotic succession.A', u'At the same time, the White House has admitted that Cuba may follow the Vietnam model: embracing the economic and strategic benefits of closer ties with the United States without enacting significant democratic reforms.W', u'When it comes to the relationship between Washington and Hanoi, Obama built on two decades of presidential diplomacy that enjoys bipartisan support in Congress. ', u'It was Bill Clinton who ended the U.S. trade embargo in 1994 and restored diplomatic relations in 1995. ', u'George W. Bush visited the country in 2006 and promised deeper ties while pushing greater religious freedom.O', u'Obama visited Vietnam in May, when he lifted an embargo on arms sales that dated back to the aftermath of the war and visited the home of the country s revolutionary leader, Ho Chi Minh. ', u'I come here mindful of the past, mindful of our difficult history, but focused on the future   the prosperity, security and human dignity that we can advance together,  he said.O', u'Obama s acknowledgments of the scars of the conflict  had a cleansing effect,  Rhodes said. ', u'They helped to enable Vietnam  to say,  Well, maybe now we can pursue greater military cooperation with the United States. ', u'Vietnam wasn t the only Southeast Asian country Obama courted during his eight years in office. ', u'Starting in late 2011, his administration worked to improve relations with Burma (also known as Myanmar). ', u'In November 2012, he became the first sitting U.S. president to visit that country. ', u'It was risky,  Rhodes said.A', u'And political and economic reforms have been uneven, even though the country earlier this year replaced military leaders with its first civilian president in five decades. ', u'Burma s iconic democracy champion Aung San Suu Kyi is no longer under house arrest but cannot serve in the top executive branch spot due to the military-drafted constitution.S', u'Still, Obama s outreach gets praise from Republicans in Congress, including the top expert on U.S.-Burma relations, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ', u'Burma s transition to a democratically elected government is an important mark of reform in a country with a long and very troubled history,  McConnell said earlier this year. ', u'We know there s more to be done, but the administration can take credit for its efforts and so can members of Congress in both parties. ', u'Hopefully we can build on that momentum by working together. ', u'That kind of bipartisanship goes missing when it comes to Obama s  reset  of relations with Russia. ', u'That 2009 reboot of the way Washington and Moscow interact paid some early dividends, notably Russian acceptance of a new START treaty to reduce nuclear arsenals, greater cooperation on sanctions against Iran and the reopening of air routes to resupply American forces in Afghanistan. ', u'But the policy was in tatters even before the recent bombshell Washington Post report that Russia actively worked to get Trump elected. ', u'President Vladimir Putin openly fueled anti-American sentiment at home and pursued confrontational policies abroad, such as the invasion of Ukraine and the annexation of its Crimea region. ', u'One of the key architects of the U.S. policy, former ambassador to Russia Michael McFaul, said in May 2015 that the next president should not try to duplicate it. ', u'With Russia, we got a long way with [former Russian President Dmitry] Medvedev, and then engagement hit a brick wall when we went from Medvedev to Putin,  Rhodes said. ', u'It might be tempting to look at the Iran nuclear deal in the broader context of Obama s foreign engagement. ', u'But Rhodes said the agreement wasn t designed to transform relations. ', u'The Burmese decided to change their political system. ', u'The Cubans decided to engage and make some changes to their economic system. ', u'Iran did not make a similar decision,  he said. ', u'Iran made a decision to make a deal on the nuclear issue, but we don t expect them to fundamentally alter their system or their behavior. ', u'Likewise, the symbolic setting aside of World War II grievances with Japan isn t expected to fundamentally alter relations between the two allies. ', u'The president is of the view that   as he has done with American history   the candid accounting of history is a necessary first step,  Rhodes said. ', u'It s just one of the pieces of unfinished business. ']

[u'The massive fire that tore through a converted warehouse in Oakland, killing 36 people in the deadliest blaze in the United States in more than a decade, has officials examining similar illegal spaces   and the artists who create, perform and, in many cases, live in them bracing for a crackdown.A', u'Authorities are still trying to determine what caused the Dec. 2 fire, which broke out during a concert inside what was known as the Ghost Ship, a 4,000-square-foot building that former tenants described as  a death trap with few exits, a rickety makeshift staircase, piles of driftwood and a labyrinth of electrical cords. ', u'In Baltimore, dozens of artists living in a building known as the Bell Foundry were evicted last week after the city said it received a complaint  about individuals living there in deplorable conditions. ', u'The main electrical source had illegal, dangerous connections; there were extension cords used to feed multiple fixtures,  said Katy Byrne, a spokeswoman for Baltimore s Department of Housing and Community Development. ', u'None of the electrical systems was grounded. ', u'In Denver, fire officials shut down Rhinoceropolis, a landmark  DIY  performance space, and evicted five people who had been living in illegal lofts on Thursday after it was deemed  unsafe. ', u'While the Denver Fire Department did not immediately specify what those safety violations were, a 2015 profile of the venue by Denver s Westword gives a hint:  The space is divided into two main areas   one for living and one for performing. ', u'But that line is constantly blurred: Music and art performances have taken place in the bathroom and the kitchen, bedrooms have become art installations, and the building itself has been transformed into a haunted house. ', u'Drum kits have been set on fire, sod has been rolled out and performed on top of, fireworks have been set off inside, and car parts, glitter and food have been hurled at audiences. ', u'Anything can happen at a Rhino show. ', u'In Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney announced a citywide crackdown on spaces like the Ghost Ship. ', u'As Philadelphia mourns with the people of Oakland, it s also important to examine how we can prevent similar tragedies form occurring here,  Kenney said in a statement three days after the Oakland fire. ', u'In our city there are unlawfully converted buildings and underground clubs, and while [the Department of Licenses and Inspections] works hard to track down these hazardous locations and enforce the fire code, they can t do it alone. ', u'Kenney called on residents to report illegal holiday parties  in unsafe and misused spaces. ', u'Especially where there are crowds, low lighting, loud music, late hours and alcohol,  he added,  the right licenses, permits and inspections save lives. ', u'In New York City, the Loft Law   first enacted in the early 1980s during the booming Soho art scene   and subsequent city task forces have forced many operators of illegal living spaces to bring them up to code, and cracked down on those who fail to comply.T', u'Those measures, coupled with industrial neighborhoods becoming more and more gentrified, mean that fewer and fewer illegal spaces like the Ghost Ship exist within the five boroughs.B', u'But make no mistake, they do still exist.T', u'The New York Times reported investigations prompted by the Oakland warehouse blaze in other cities, including Nashville, Dallas, Austin, Indianapolis, New Haven, Conn., and Dubuque, Iowa.I', u'In Oakland, some residents are wondering if the city missed repeated warnings about the Ghost Ship.

', u'At a press conference late last week, officials said that it appeared the warehouse was not equipped with smoke detectors and had no exits on the second floor. ', u'And Oakland Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O Malley said a criminal investigation is underway. ', u'Derick Almena, the de facto landlord and self-described  father  of the Ghost Ship, who lived in the warehouse with his wife and children, defended the conditions inside.

', u'We laid our bodies down there. ', u'We put our children to bed there every night. ', u'We made music. ', u'We created art. ', u'We opened our home.

Now, we saw it with our own eyes," he told The Associated Press.T', u"The bombing of the Boutrossyia chapel   and another one Friday that killed six police   were grim reminders of Egypt's struggle to restore security and stability after nearly six years of turmoil.E", u'Egypt has seen a wave of attacks by Islamic militants since 2013, when the military overthrew President Mohammed Morsi, a freely elected leader and a senior Muslim Brotherhood official. ', u'Many of his supporters blamed Christians for supporting his ouster, and scores of churches and other Christian-owned properties in southern Egypt were ransacked that year.S', u'Since 2013, authorities have waged a sweeping crackdown, outlawing the Muslim Brotherhood, jailing thousands of mostly Islamist dissidents and killing hundreds in street clashes.T', u"There was no immediate claim of responsibility for Sunday's attack.O", u'One of the worst previous attacks against Christians by Islamic militants was a 2011 bombing at a church in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria that killed 21.T', u'The Islamic State group also has targeted Christians in the Sinai Peninsula, where it primarily goes after security forces. ', u'Most IS attacks in Egypt have been confined to security personnel and judicial officials.F', u"Friday's police bombing was claimed by a group that authorities say is linked to the Muslim Brotherhood. ", u'That group   called "Hasm," or "Decisiveness"   distanced itself from Sunday\'s attack in a statement that said it does not as a principle kill women, children, the elderly or worshippers. ', u'The Brotherhood, in a separate statement, condemned the attack.T', u'The bombings are almost certain to undermine the modest recovery in recent months by the vital tourism sector after years of slumping that followed the 2011 popular uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.T', u'They also could bolster the argument used by the government of President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi that stability and security are top priorities if Egypt is to prosper economically and avoid sliding into the kind of chaos and violence now seen in countries like Libya, Syria and Yemen.S', u"Sunday's bombing was condemned by government and religious leaders, and drew calls for unity between Egypt's Muslim majority and Christians, who account for about 10 percent of the country's 92 million people.W", u'Witnesses said the blast probably was caused by a bomb planted in the chapel. ', u"Bishop Moussa, a senior cleric, said there were unconfirmed reports of a woman posing as a worshipper leaving a bag in the women's section before slipping out.A", u'AP reporters who went in the chapel noted that the side where women are routinely seated suffered the worst damage. ', u'Pews were smeared with blood and stained glass windows and wooden cabinets were blown out. ', u"A broken pair of glasses lay next to a girl's boots with leopard spots and a pink ribbon. ", u'A chandelier dangled precariously and a wall clock was stopped at 9:57 a.m."', u'"I found bodies, many of them women, lying on the pews. It was a horrible scene," said church worker Attiya Mahrous, who rushed to the chapel after the blast. ', u'His clothes and hands were stained with blood and his hair was matted with dust.M', u'Men and women wailed and cried outside. ', u'"I saw a headless woman being carried away," Mariam Shenouda said as she pounded her chest in grief. ', u'"Everyone was in a state of shock." "', u'"There were children," she added. ', u'"What have they done to deserve this? I wish I had died with them instead of seeing these scenes." P', u"Pope Tawadros II, spiritual leader of Egypt's Orthodox Christians, cut short a visit to Greece to return home. ", u'State TV broadcast appeals by hospitals for blood donations, and el-Sissi declared three days of mourning. ', u'"The pain felt by Egyptians now will not go to waste, but will instead result in an uncompromising decisiveness to hunt down and bring to trial whoever helped   through inciting, facilitating, participating or executing   in this heinous crime," a presidential statement quoted him as saying. ', u'Several hundred angry people gathered outside the cathedral, chanting anti-government slogans and calling for the firing of the interior minister, who is in charge of security. ', u'"We sacrifice our soul and blood for the cross," some chanted. ', u'Others sang hymns and, raising their hands, shouted, "Lord, have mercy." S', u'Scuffles broke out when protesters tried to push police lines to move closer to the cathedral, but there were no immediate reports of arrests. ', u'Police in full riot gear arrived later. ', u"Egypt's Christians have long complained of discrimination, saying they are denied top jobs in many fields, including academia and security forces. ", u'The church and many Christians have rallied behind el-Sissi, although there have been growing voices of dissent in the community. ', u'They say little has changed under his rule, with authorities failing to halt attacks on their churches and property. ', u'"This government must resign, and if the president insists on keeping it, then he\'d better resign as well," said Gerges Wadie, the brother of Ramzy\'s wife. ', u'He said he initially supported el-Sissi but now sees him as a "failure."']

[u'People like Mohammed Zorgui.R', u'Rhyme and reason After finishing his song, Zorgui sits back in his chair and makes it clear that he won t be joining the throngs lining up outside for Friday prayers. ', u'I m done with that,  he says.Z', u'Zorgui s descent into extremism started when he was arrested following a drunken brawl in May 2013. ', u'With Tunisia s crammed jails and overworked courts, it would mean months   perhaps years   before he would appear before a judge.W', u'When Zorgui entered prison in El Kef, 100 miles northwest of Tunis, he quickly learned the hierarchy. ', u'A group of 20 men with long beards and Afghan-style thobes ordered the other prisoners around   organizing meal times, cleaning cells, and leading prayers and daily lessons. ', u'The Salafists were running the prison,  he says.M', u'Many of the jihadists were being held on minor charges: destroying police property, firing live rounds in the air. ', u'Zorgui believes they were merely a cover allowing the men to enter the prison and recruit from within.I', u'In their conversations, sermons, and classes, the jihadis preached the same message: The Tunisian state was unjust, and therefore un-Islamic. ', u'It must be fought. ', u'For dozens of young Tunisians struggling in a stagnant economy, let down by the failed promises of the revolution and now incarcerated, the message resonated.Z', u'Zorgui found himself gradually drawn into their orbit. ', u'He listened intensely to the daily religious lessons. ', u'He grew his beard several inches and prayed five times a day.A', u'As the weeks went on, the lessons started to change. ', u'Along with Quranic verses, they were teaching prisoners hand-to-hand combat. ', u'The jihadists even taught their new followers how to make an improvised explosive device with 20 Tunisian dinars ($10), a mobile phone, and an empty cooking-oil canister. ', u'They were training us to be an army of lone wolves,  he says. ', u'And we were ready pupils. ', u'When they ordered Zorgui to kill his brother-in-law, who they claimed was an  infidel  because he had previously served in the Tunisian armed forces, the rapper says he  snapped out of it. ', u'The Tunisian Prison Department transferred Zorgui to a local jail in Kasserine, where jihadists did not have a strong presence. ', u'Zorgui was angry and confused. ', u'He had so many words in his heart he wanted to release. ', u'So he began writing. ', u'The words turned into poems. ', u'The poems turned into rap. ', u'Rap is a revolutionary art,  he says. ', u'Any oppression or injustice can be battled with rap. ', u'Zorgui now has a new purpose: to use lyrics and rhymes highlighting jihadists  hypocrisy. ', u'He mixes Quranic verses with Tunisian slang, calling on Tunisians to protect Islam from IS.S', u'Since being released in August 2014, Zorgui has crisscrossed the country, performing in 17 prisons. ', u'He hopes to take part in several cultural festivals this year. ', u'For each event, the state gives Zorgui and the three others who perform with him $200, which goes for renting DJ equipment and a sound system. ', u'In his neighborhood of Hay al Karma, lined with desolate beige and gray concrete homes, Zorgui points out house after house where family members have left to become jihadists. ', u'Some have stayed behind in Kasserine to recruit youths, more than 50 percent of whom are unemployed. ', u'The jihadist sympathizers threaten Zorgui daily   vowing to cut out his tongue to silence his rap. ', u'Two bearded men glare at Zorgui as he walks to his front door. ', u'For them I am a threat,  he says,  because I tell their secrets. ', u'MP on a mission Mazen Dalaeen steps out from a room packed with dozens of supporters and briskly walks into his back office, shutting the door behind him. ', u'Even in the heat of a campaign season in the southern Jordanian town of Karak, there are certain calls the member of parliament has to take. ', u'Have you heard any news? ', u'Has he contacted you?  he says into the phone. ', u'The urgent subject: the fate of yet another Jordanian caught in the grips of IS. ', u'A veteran businessman and parliamentarian, Mr. Dalaeen was not the most obvious candidate to lead Jordan s campaign against IS. ', u'But everything changed for him in June 2015 when he received a Facebook message from his son, Mohammad, who he believed to be completing his third year of medical school in Ukraine. ', u'Instead, he had joined IS. ', u'Efforts to find his son led to dead ends on the Turkish-Syrian border and angry rebuttals from Mohammad. ', u'Then in October 2015 came the news Dalaeen feared most: Mohammad had killed himself in a truck bombing in Ramadi, Iraq. ', u'Three weeks later, as Dalaeen struggled to piece together how he could have lost his son to extremism, his new calling arrived in the form of a phone call. ', u'A constituent from his hometown, Karak, was panicked. ', u'His daughter Amal (not her real name) had abruptly left for Turkey. ', u'She had texted her parents that she was leaving to join IS in Syria. ', u'What can we do before we lose her?  they asked. ', u'Dalaeen alerted the Jordanian ambassador in Turkey and Turkish authorities along the border. ', u'But knowing from his own experience that police work alone is not enough, he knew he had to reach out to the girl himself. ', u'Amal finally called Dalaeen back on WhatsApp. ', u'The MP cited each and every hadith and Quranic verse he could think of. ', u'Yet he knew he was making no progress. ', u'So he handed the phone to his wife. ', u'She appealed to Amal in a way Dalaeen could not. ', u'She spoke from the heart of a mother mourning her son,  Dalaeen says. ', u'That is the most powerful voice there is. ', u'Amal was moved. ', u'She said she wanted to return home. ', u'Shortly thereafter, the girl managed to slip out and take a taxi to a hotel where Jordanian embassy staff put her on a flight home. ', u'Amal is now an activist who speaks out against IS to youth audiences. ', u'Dalaeen, meanwhile, has become a champion for Jordanians fearing that their loved ones are being recruited by IS. ', u'He has returned several young Jordanians on the brink of joining IS in Syria, and has prevented dozens more from being recruited within the kingdom. ', u'An estimated 3,000 Jordanians now serve in IS s ranks, and despite tightened security along the Jordanian-Syrian border, authorities have struggled to prevent others from entering through Turkey. ', u'Dalaeen (who lost his reelection bid in September) regularly speaks out against the false message of IS to university students across the country. ', u'Dalaeen places his phone on the desk and shakes his head. ', u'ISIS claimed my son s life,  he says. ', u'But they will not claim Jordan s future. ', u'Start-up Tunisia T', u'Terror struck the heart of Tunisia on June 25, 2015, when a gunman killed 38 tourists on a beach near the resort town of Sousse. ', u'In the eyes of the media, the model for liberal democracy in the Middle East had become a terrorist hotbed. ', u'Aslam Souli gathered that day with a dozen friends and fellow youth activists in a Tunis cafe. ', u'They were upset. ', u'They were angry. ', u'They wanted to take Tunisia, which has seen more than 6,000 of its residents join the ranks of IS, back from the narrative of terrorists. ', u'So the group launched the National Youth Initiative Against Terrorism. ', u'Rather than calling for heightened security or media awareness, the young activists decided to offer something new to at-risk Tunisians: an alternative. ', u'Working in communities beset by extremism, the coalition provides young people with training in a variety of  soft skills : language proficiency, computer literacy, job searches, and other tasks ranging from administration to communication. ', u'The group then urges participants to float ideas for new ventures. ', u'Those with successful proposals are given grants of as much as $300 to start their own businesses. ', u'We have a simple counternarrative: Justice is something you have to take; it is not given to you   and ISIS will not give it to you,  says Mr. Souli, a fifth-year medical student. ', u'The coalition has produced results. ', u'In its first year alone, the initiative claims to have helped dozens of at-risk and formally radicalized Tunisians  return from the path of jihad. ', u'The coalition has grown to include five organizations with a total of more than 100 members that can be found in nearly all of Tunisia s 24 provinces. ', u'But the group is limited in what it can do. ', u'Tunisia s far-reaching antiterror law prevents it from providing training and support to the hundreds of Tunisians returning from Libya, Syria, and Iraq. ', u'The Youth Initiative activists see them as a potential resource in the fight against extremism, but the government is still suspicious of returning fighters. ', u'Still, the coalition is helping many others. ', u'We can t promise to change their lives,  says Souli. ', u'But we can give them the tools to change their situation. ', u'Taking back mosques   O', u'Omar Mighri is an imam at a mosque in the working-class suburb of Ben Arous, south of Tunis. ', u'This,  he says, opening a leather-bound copy of the Quran on his lap,  is my weapon. ', u'He represents a burgeoning effort across the Middle East to counter IS from the pulpit. ', u'Mighri s campaign began in the summer of 2013, when the Tunisian government dispatched the imam to check on mosques in his hometown of Kairouan, a center of Islamic learning in North Africa dating back to AD 670. ', u'What he saw horrified him. ', u'Jihadists had taken over...,  he says. ', u'Our mosques had become training camps. ', u'Several places of worship had fallen under the control of hard-line Salafists and jihadists following the 2011 revolution. ', u'Nationwide, an estimated 1,000 of Tunisia s more than 5,000 mosques had been similarly taken over. ', u'Backed by police, Mighri s group drove dozens of unlicensed imams from the pulpit. ', u'In their place, they installed new clerics who were highly educated and trained to speak out on community needs. ', u'The imams organized classes to encourage proper interpretation of Quranic texts. ', u'The moves had an impact. ', u'Tunisia s Ministry of Religious Affairs has copied the model, and has held similar social outreach in communities affected by extremism. ', u'Eighty percent of Tunisians only know the basics of the religion   praying and fasting   but do not know the fiqh or theology behind it,  says Mighri. ', u'We must answer ignorance with knowledge. ', u'That is the true weapon in the war on extremism. ', u'Mahfouth Ben Deraa is trying to thwart jihadism through the Quran as well. ', u'Dressed in worn jeans and a polo shirt speckled with white paint, he looks more like a drywaller than an imam. ', u'But the 20-something cleric, whose mosque lies near territory where Al Qaeda- and IS-aligned jihadists roam, sits at the nexus of the war on extremism. ', u'Ben Deraa had been delivering sermons in 2012 when he noticed young men in his neighborhood disappearing from the mosque   all joining Al Qaeda. ', u'So he decided to visit the homes of each of them. ', u'Sometimes the emergency interventions would last until 2 a.m. ', u'Later, Ben Deraa began hosting a weekly radio program, during which he would challenge the jihadist militants who were attempting to overthrow the state. ', u'When you face extremists with guns and bullets, they fight to their last breath,  he says. ', u'When you face them with the Quran and hadith, they lose their power and are instantly defeated. ', u'Ben Deraa s growing visibility has come with dangers. ', u'The imam says he receives death threats daily from jihadist supporters. ', u'In late June, Ben Deraa was delivering an evening prayer when a man walked up behind him, pressed a knife to his throat, and threatened to  slaughter him like a sheep. ', u'Many other clerics would like to speak out against IS but are either afraid or worried about money. ', u'Tunisia pays its clerics an average stipend of $100 per month, barely enough to cover the costs of running a mosque. ', u'This has driven many of Tunisia s 3,000 licensed imams to work part time in various day jobs   construction, farming, baking. ', u'Ben Deraa runs a hardware store. ', u'Being an imam is a full-time job, but we in Tunisia have to treat it as a hobby,  says Ben Deraa, as he retrieves three gallons of blue paint for a customer before heading off to lead afternoon prayers. ', u'The situation room  F', u'From a third-floor office in Amman, a team of social media experts and web designers sits around desks brimming with computers and server stacks. ', u'They re waging a global information war. ', u'Jamil Abu Sara, a Muslim legal expert, directs the unit. ', u'Wearing a creaseless robe and tightly wrapped white turban, he monitors the latest chatter from extremist groups on social media. ', u'Have we responded yet to the question on Al Wala Wal Bara and doing business in non-Muslim countries? ', u'Abu Sara asks his colleagues. ', u'Issue the statement. ', u'Here, at Jordan s Iftaa Department, a network of 32 Muslim legal experts (muftis) with centuries of Islamic education between them run a global fatwa  situation room. ', u'Tasked with clarifying issues related to sharia (Islamic law), the members respond to false religious claims made by groups such as IS and field questions from Muslims across the world. ', u'Established in 1921 to clarify Jordanians  questions on Islamic affairs, the department was broadened in 2006 to an independent institution tasked with using the latest technology to reach out to the kingdom s growing population. ', u'It now churns out 220,000 fatwas a year. ', u'It has become a global reference point for all things Islam   and a first responder to IS. ', u'There are fatwas that have no basis in Islam, and there are fatwas derived from a selective reading of an obscure historical source,  says Abdul Karim Khasawneh, grand mufti of Jordan. ', u'We counter them all. ', u'In addition to 25 phone hotlines, the Iftaa Department answers religious questions from around the world through its website, WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and other outlets. ', u'While many of the queries are relatively routine, such as regarding rules about Ramadan fasting for students taking exams, it receives a stream of questions from Muslims grappling, and perhaps siding, with IS s ideology. ', u'These are the questions we take very seriously, and respond to as swiftly as possible,  Abu Sara says. ', u'In February 2015, when IS issued a video of the immolation of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh, the militants cited a 13th- century scholar who lived through several Mongol invasions of modern Syria as a rationale for the killing. ', u'The Iftaa Department responded with several sayings by the prophet Muhammad that prisoners must be treated with  mercy,  undermining IS s claims. ', u'The rejoinder went viral   garnering more than 1 million shares and views. ', u'We are on the front lines of the ideological and theological war against ISIS, and we have to move fast,  says Abu Sara. ', u'Related stories B', u'Become a part of the Monitor community']

[u"By Caroline Valetkevitch              NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices surged to an 18-month high on Monday after the world's top crude producers agreed to the first joint output cut since 2001, sparking concerns about inflation, which pushed up U.S. ", u'Treasury yields to a more than two-year peak. ', u'Yields also gained ahead of a two-day Federal Reserve policy meeting that starts on Tuesday, where the U.S. central bank is expected to raise interest rates for the only the second time since the global financial crisis. ', u'The gain in oil prices followed the weekend agreement between OPEC and key non-OPEC states.

But it will be to some extent tempered by a little bit of an impact on consumer spending," said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer of Hugh Johnson Advisors LLC in Albany, New York.

[u'It s not every day that a self-proclaimed white nationalist calls you an  honorary white person. ', u'He was joking, of course, after I said I enjoyed a recent trip near his home in Whitefish, Montana. ', u'It would have been light-hearted banter in any other context, but not this one.B', u'Because Richard Spencer had just told me with a smile on his face that I would not be allowed to live in the all-white ethno-state he envisions for the future. ', u'You could have your own ethno-state,  he offered, as though ethnic cleansing might strike most Americans as anything other than reprehensible. ', u'Nightline  asked to spend the day with him before his Texas A  University appearance on Tuesday as he was confronted by hundreds of loud protesters chanting  Say NO to hate. ', u'He seemed unfazed, amused even, and clearly unapologetic.M', u'My producer Victoria Thompson and I traveled to College Station, Texas, to bring into sharp focus the man who takes credit for coining the phrase  alt-right,  which Spencer describes as  identity politics for white people in the 21st century. ', u'Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News and Trump s current chief strategist, was once quoted as saying his site provided a  platform for the alt-right. ', u'Days after the election, President-Elect Trump tried to distance himself from the alt-right with one quote in an interview with the New York Times. -- "I don\'t want to energize the group, and I disavow the group," he said.S', u'Spencer, 38, earned national attention after a video surfaced on  The Atlantic  showing him at a so-called  alt right  conference shouting  Hail Trump, hail our people, hail victory,  as some in the crowd raised their hands in a Nazi salute.S', u'Spencer says he yelled out  Hail Trump,   in the spirit of irony and exuberance. ', u'What is exuberant about genocide? ', u'I asked him.H', u'He then tried to dismiss it, telling me,  a half a dozen people in the audience or so who gave a Roman salute. ', u'It was not a Roman salute. ', u'It was a Nazi party salute, you know that,  I replied.S', u'Spencer did acknowledge that provocation is a strategy for the alt-right and that he had been toiling in obscurity until this shot of notoriety. ', u'He sees President-Elect Trump as someone who  sling-shot our movement into fame. ', u'Spencer says he was euphoric the moment he found out Trump won the presidency,  it felt like a kind of miracle. ', u'If someone had told me two years ago that Donald Trump would be the alt-right hero and he would be President, I would be like,  What ridiculous movie are you talking about like this is not real life,  but it is real life,  Spencer said.S', u'Spencer and I talked one-on-one for more than an hour. ', u'He claims he is not a white supremacist or a racist, but it is difficult to understand his incendiary rhetoric any other way.I', u'I asked about his quote in Mother Jones magazine that  Hispanics and African Americans have lower average IQs than whites and are more genetically predisposed to commit crimes  -- a pseudo-science argument of white supremacists which has been widely discredited. ', u'When you study, say average intelligence say around the world, and you keep getting the same answer, at some point you are going to have to look towards genetics  Spencer said. ', u'He spouts many of the hallmarks of vitriolic racist ideology.H', u'His deeply inflammatory world-view involves that all-white  ethno state  perhaps outside the U.S., he says, where races are segregated. ', u'He claims there would be no forced deportations, though says it could result in a violent race war. ', u'I think the current paradigm we re living under is going to lead to blood and tears,  Spencer said. ', u"I don't know exactly what is going to happen but yes I do think that there is going to be a major crack up  predominantly on racial lines. ", u'You might ask why devote so much attention to what many consider a fringe hate group? ', u'It was Louis Brandeis a century ago who famously wrote  Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. ', u'Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.   [Spencer] is the head of the alt right   and quite frankly Mr. Trump ran a racially divisive campaign, so I think the media has an obligation to cover Richard Spencer,  said Southern Poverty Law Center s President Richard Cohen. ', u'Spencer s organization, the National Policy Institute, is listed as a hate group by the SPLC for promoting far-right, white-nationalist views. ', u'The term alt-right is really nothing more than a re-branding of white supremacy for the digital age,  said Cohen. ', u'I don t think anybody should be fooled by what it is at its core and that is white supremacy. ', u'The Texas A  campus held a diverse yet unified presence of thousands of people demonstrating their opposition to his views by attending competing events: a rowdy protest, a silent protest and a concert at the football stadium next door celebrating diversity. ', u'Texas A , in keeping with Justice Brandeis  prescription, decided not to ban him, citing freedom of speech. ', u'The university had not invited Spencer to speak on Tuesday, but a room was booked on campus by a former student. ', u'University President Michael Young spoke at the Aggie s football stadium unity rally and said,  I believe we live in a world where differences actually makes us stronger. ', u"Rather than keep quiet about Spencer s visit, the university managed to turn it into a teachable moment -- allowing Spencer s freedom of speech, while supporting protesters' freedoms of expression as well. ", u'While Spencer is undeterred by the protests, his Nazi saluting followers were notably absent. ', u'In the end, the overwhelming majority of the few hundred people who did show up to hear him speak were there in protest. ', u'Tensions erupted during Spencer s speech several times. ', u'He fat-shamed a female protester dressed as a clown for effect and spewed insults at a man who stood patiently in line to ask a question, even before he had a chance to ask his question. ', u'You re a coward. ', u'You can t beat the ---- out of anything,  he said. ', u'You need to go to the gym."', u'" His tone reminded me of an exchange Spencer and I had during our long conversation when he laughingly dismissed values like compassion, diversity, even freedom as  weak  or  lame.  I pointed out that these are bedrock principles of our country,  diversity, inclusion, Lady Liberty bring us your huddled masses."  ', u'I would keep Lady Liberty. ', u'I think that s a beautiful statue," he said, laughing. "I would tear down that stupid horrible poem about \'Send us your worst! ', u'Send us your ugliest, your stupidest. ', u'Let them wash up on our shores!\'" Tensions ran high just outside as Spencer spoke, police in riot gear wound up pushing people out of the building where he was talking. But in the end, it was the anti-hate folks who showed up at the Kyle Stadium -- including a multi-cultural group of students and anti-hate groups   that sent a far more powerful message of tolerance and diversity to drown out what they considered the repugnant and unwelcome din next door.']

[u'Lyle Denniston, Constitution Daily s Supreme Court correspondent, looks at several significant cases denied for consideration by the Supreme Court on Monday morning.T', u'The Supreme Court refused on Monday to hear complaints that the settlement of a multitude of lawsuits by former pro football players over head injuries did not provide adequately for one of most serious forms of brain trauma. ', u'The Justices offered no explanation as they turned aside appeals by two groups of retired players, leaving intact the 2015 deal that ended the lawsuits.I', u'In a separate action, the Justices refused   over two dissenting votes   to stop Ohio from going ahead with a second attempt to execute a death-row inmate, after the first attempt had failed in 2009, causing the inmate serious pain before the procedure was called off because the execution team could not get an IV inserted to transmit the lethal drug combination. ', u'The denial of review of the case of Romell Broom of Cleveland was one action among several in recent days that prompted Justice Stephen G. Breyer to call anew for a study of whether the death penalty is unconstitutional as a form of  cruel and unusual punishment. ', u'The Court also passed up a plea for it to reconsider, in light of the new mode of consumer goods sales via the Internet, old precedents that limit the power of states to impose taxes on out-of-state companies that sell to in-state customers. ', u'The prior precedents have been widely criticized as seriously out of date with modern forms of retailing, as well as too tight a restriction on state taxing power over goods flowing into the state from outside.T', u'The National Football League had faced years of criticism for allegedly trying to cover up the problem of serious head injuries that players suffered from concussions that occurred during games or practices. ', u'A popular movie was made about the sports scandal.S', u'Scores of lawsuits by former players, or by relatives of ex-players who had died, led ultimately to intensive efforts to reach a settlement after the cases were combined as a class-action effort in a Philadelphia federal court.A', u'A settlement finally came in April 2015, providing mainly for payments to players or their families if they had developed one of a half-dozen forms of brain disease or dysfunction, including Alzheimer s and dementia. ', u'But, for most players, the settlement did not provide payments for those who developed one particular form of trauma   the medical condition known as CTE   Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy. ', u'The condition, it seems, can only be diagnosed after a person having it has died, and their brain is then examined. ', u'Medical experts who examined the brains of deceased players found symptoms of the trauma in almost all cases.T', u'The negotiators left CTE victims mostly out of the final deal, on the theory that not enough was known about it in current medical science to provide an adequate financial arrangement. ', u'The settlement does provide that, if a player develops symptoms of one of the other forms of  brain trauma that might be related to CTE, they could receive a payment.A', u'A federal judge approved the settlement, and the U.S. ', u'Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld that ruling. ', u'That was the one left intact by the Justices on Monday. ', u'There was no indication of any dissent.W', u'While the players who objected to the final settlement told the Supreme Court that the deal leaves out perhaps 72 percent of former players who may suffer from brain trauma, the NFL told the court that the final plan will ultimately pay out nearly $1 billion, to perhaps 20,000 ex-players. ', u'The NFL vigorously defended the deal in its filings with the Justices, arguing that those who objected to the settlement were only a small percentage of those affected by it.I', u'In the Ohio death penalty case, Justices Breyer and Elena Kagan were the only dissenters as the court refused to hear claims that a second attempt at execution after the first attempt had failed is itself a form of cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. ', u'The inmate argued, in addition, that the first attempt   which involved 18 pain-inducing attempts to insert an IV line   was also a violation of the Eighth Amendment.T', u'The court last ruled on a second execution attempt in a deeply split decision in 1947, in the case of Louisiana ex rel. ', u'In that case, an electric chair failed to operate properly. ', u'The Supreme Court refused to block a new attempt. ', u'In the new Ohio case, the state Supreme Court had partly relied on that precedent in rejecting Romell Broom s constitutional challenges.B', u'Broom s lawyers had argued that the 1947 precedent did not apply, because the court had said in that ruling that the failure could not have been foreseen and the procedure was handled in a humane way. ', u'Broom s situation was very different, his lawyers contended, because the execution team had not been properly trained, did not follow the existing protocol, and brought in an outside doctor who also botched the attempt to find a vein that would work to deliver the lethal drugs.B', u'Breyer and Kagan did not file their views as part of the order that denied review of Broom s appeal. ', u'But Breyer, writing only for himself, referred to the Broom case and others on which the court had recently denied review to repeat points he had made earlier   that the death penalty is carried out now in a random and arbitrary manner, and that inmates are left lingering on death row for years as they contemplate their coming deaths. ', u'Breyer has several times called for a review of the death penalty s validity.I', u'In the Internet sales cases that the court refused to hear on Monday, the Justices left undisturbed two precedents   one from 1967 and another from 1992   that bar states from imposing sales or use taxes on the merchandise sold in the state by companies that have no stores, offices, warehouses, employees, or payroll in the state  States contend that those precedents severely limit the power of states to collect taxes on vast amounts of merchandise sold to their residents. ', u'In more recent years, the court has refused multiple times to reconsider those prior rulings.L', u'Legendary journalist Lyle Denniston is Constitution Daily s Supreme Court correspondent.

', u'Cefas analysed the locations and temperatures of where fish were being caught and detected "long-term changes" in the quantities of certain fish to make predictions about the future of the North Sea, where much of the UK\'s fish is caught. ', u'The data revealed that squid numbers have increased dramatically over the past 35 years, while cod numbers have been "slow to recover" after they were heavily overfished in the 1980s and 1990s. ', u'"Our models for 2025 and beyond suggest that seawater temperature may continue to rise in the future. As a result, UK waters will become more hospitable for some species and less suitable for others, with the overall result that most commercial species will move northwards," says Pinnegar. ', u'"I would anticipate that currently small-scale fisheries targeting warm-water species such as squid, sardine and anchovy will continue to expand. They will probably represent a greater share of UK fisheries catches in 10 years  time,  Pinnegar continued.   Not sure "squid and chips" has quite the same ring to it, unfortunately.

[u"Tehran (AFP) - Iran's President Hassan Rouhani on Tuesday ordered the country's scientists to start work on nuclear-powered ships in response to the expected renewal of sanctions by the United States.I", u'In letters read out on state television, Rouhani criticised the US move as a breach of last year\'s nuclear accord and told Iran\'s Atomic Energy Organisation to start work on "planning the design and production of nuclear fuel and reactors for maritime transport."The president said he had also ordered the foreign ministry to prepare a legal complaint to the international committee that oversees the nuclear accord.U', u"Under the deal signed in July 2015, world powers agreed to lift international sanctions in exchange for curbs to Iran's nuclear programme.B", u'But US lawmakers recently voted to renew 10-year-old sanctions legislation against Iran related not just to nuclear issues, but also ballistic missile-testing and human rights.P', u"President Barack Obama is expected to sign the measure into law in the coming days, saying it makes no difference to last year's agreement because the White House will continue to suspend all the sanctions linked to Iran's nuclear programme.I", u'Iranian lawmakers had raised the prospect of building nuclear-powered ships and submarines back in 2012 at the height of tensions with the international community over the nuclear programme.I', u'International analysts said the announcement was likely just a bluff, since it would be an extremely costly effort for little strategic gain.T', u'Then nuclear chief Fereydoon Abbasi Davani said that Iran had the capacity to design nuclear reactors for ships but no plans to do so.H', u'He also said that nuclear-powered ships did not require the sort of highly enriched uranium which could also be used for weapons.- Agreement wording ambiguous -Iran has always insisted that its nuclear programme was entirely peaceful, but hoped an end to sanctions would help revive its battered economy.A', u'Although it has seen a significant boost in oil sales since the deal came into force in January, its hopes of attracting large-scale foreign investment have been thwarted by continuing US sanctions in other areas.T', u'The biggest problem lies with world banks, which are needed to finance the bigger trade deals but remain wary of returning to Iran, fearing they could be fined by Washington.T', u'The Iran Sanctions Act passed the US Senate 99-0 earlier this month after easily clearing the House of Representatives in November.T', u'The language in the nuclear agreement makes it unclear whether renewing the sanctions -- and keeping the nuclear ones suspended -- amounts to a violation.A', u'At a press conference last week, conservative parliament speaker Ali Larijani said parts of the deal were "rushed"."', u'"Some of the sections of the JCPOA should have been written with more precision to stop differing interpretations," Larijani said.R', u'Rouhani, who is expected to run for a second term in May, has faced a barrage of criticism from conservatives who say his team made too many concessions for minimal economic gain.

[u'On Tuesday morning, President-elect Donald Trump confirmed the rumors that ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson would be his choice for secretary of state. ', u'Tillerson, 64, is a lifelong employee of the energy giant and was described by Trump as  one of the truly great business leaders in the world. ', u'He is also one who has close business ties to Russia and to its president, Vladimir Putin. ', u'He will promote regional stability and focus on the core national security interests of the United States,  Trump said in a statement. ', u'Rex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none. ', u'Tillerson s role as the head of ExxonMobil essentially made him the head of a large international force independent from the U.S. government. ', u'In the book  Private Empire: ExxonMobil and American Power,  journalist Steve Coll wrote about how the massive company had its own foreign policy, dedicated to maximizing shareholder returns.C', u'Coll summarized the ExxonMobil position in a New Yorker story Sunday:The goal of ExxonMobil s independent foreign policy has been to promote a world that is good for oil and gas production. ', u'Because oil projects require huge amounts of capital and only pay off fully over decades, Tillerson has favored doing business in countries that offer political stability, even if this stability was achieved through authoritarian rule.A', u'As one example of ExxonMobil s foreign entanglements, the company began pumping oil in the African nation of Chad in 2003, working closely with its authoritarian president, Idriss D by, who has ruled since 1990 and has been described by Foreign Policy magazine as a  paranoid tyrant. ', u'Chad has issued a $74 billion fine to Exxon in a dispute over the royalties from that deal, a number that is five times the country s GDP.C', u'Coll also has detailed how Exxon circumvented U.S. policy in the Middle East:In Kurdistan, during the Obama Administration, Tillerson defied State Department policy and cut an independent oil deal with the Kurdish Regional Government, undermining the national Iraqi government in Baghdad. ', u'ExxonMobil did not ask permission. ', u'After the fact, Tillerson arranged a conference call with State Department officials and explained his actions, according to my sources, by saying,  I had to do what was best for my shareholders. ', u'My philosophy is to make money,  Tillerson said in a 2013 interview with Charlie Rose when he was asked whether his philosophy was  Drill, baby, drill. ', u'And so if I can drill, and make money, then that s what I want to do. ', u'But it really is, for us, it s about making quality investments for our shareholders, and it s not a quality investment if you cannot manage the risk around it. ', u'Tillerson s dealing with Russia go back to 1998, when he was put in charge of Exxon operations there and in the Caspian Sea, after serving as president of Exxon Yemen Inc. He rose to CEO in 2006, and five years later he took steps to further the company s relationship with Russia, striking a deal with Rosneft, the state-owned oil giant. ', u'The deal gave Exxon the opportunity to explore for oil in the Arctic Sea and Siberia while giving Rosneft access to fracking technology and Exxon holdings in Texas and the Gulf of Mexico. ', u'The head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, is one of Putin s top lieutenants.T', u'The signing of the deal was attended by then-Prime Minister Putin, who personally awarded Tillerson the Order of Friendship in 2013. ', u'The award is given to citizens of foreign countries for  special merits in strengthening peace, friendship, cooperation and understanding between peoples  and for contributions to mutual enrichment of cultures, large-scale economic projects and/or extensive charity work.T', u'The deal was put on hold in 2014 after Russia annexed Crimea, which brought sanctions from the United States and the European Union on certain types of business deals with the county, including with Rosneft. ', u'We are very anxious to get back to work there,  said Tillerson at an Exxon analyst panel in March of their deal with Russia. ', u'It s a really an interesting, exciting area. ', u'We are very interested to get back to work in the deepwater Black Sea. ', u'They understand the situation. ', u'We understand the situation,  continued Tillerson. ', u'We are going to remain in full compliance with the sanctions. ', u'I ll tell you, we are in constant conversation with the U.S. government around ensuring that we are able to protect our rights in Russia while we have to stand still, and they ve been very supportive of that. ', u'So I m thankful that they have never done anything to try and make the situation worse. ', u'In fact they ve done things to help us hang on to the rights we have. ', u'We ve been through sanctions in countries before, and that s something governments have to work out. ', u'We would just like to make sure we can maintain our position, and when a new time comes, we are ready to go back to work. ', u'Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates have both come out in support of the Tillerson pick. ', u'They both work for Exxon through their international consulting firm, Rice Hadley Gates. ', u'James Baker, secretary of state under President George H.W. ', u'Bush, also came out in favor of Tillerson. ', u'He is a partner at a law firm that has represented both Exxon and Rosneft. ', u'I am honored by President-elect Trump s nomination and share his vision for restoring the credibility of the United States  foreign relations and advancing our country s national security,  Tillerson said in a statement released after Trump s announcement Tuesday. ', u'We must focus on strengthening our alliances, pursuing shared national interests and enhancing the strength, security and sovereignty of the United States. ']

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   He ran for president twice, but Rick Perry may be best known for two made-for-TV moments: uttering "oops" when he forgot the Energy Department was one of the agencies he pledged to eliminate and being a contestant on "Dancing with the Stars."The former Texas governor is President-elect Donald Trump\'s choice to become energy secretary, two people with knowledge of the decision say.I', u'If confirmed by the Senate, Perry is likely to shift the department away from renewable energy and toward oil and other fossil fuels that he championed during a record 14 years as governor.P', u'Perry, 66, left office in January 2015 and then launched his second ill-fated bid for the Republican presidential nomination.H', u'He was a harsh critic of Trump, even calling the billionaire businessman a "cancer to conservatism," but Perry lasted only three months in the race for the 2016 nomination before dropping out.P', u"Perry later endorsed the Republican nominee and said he'd be willing to work in a Trump administration. ", u'He re-emerged in the public spotlight in a brief appearance on this season\'s "Dancing with the Stars," where he was the second contestant eliminated.D', u'Democrats and environmental groups derided Perry\'s expected nomination, noting that he is on the record both forgetting about the Energy Department and then remembering he wanted to eliminate it."', u'"It is deeply unsettling that our current secretary of energy, a renowned nuclear physicist, could be succeeded by a contestant on \'Dancing with the Stars\'" said Rep.

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   In selecting Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as his secretary of state, President-elect Donald Trump is making the same bet he asked voters to make on him: that a track record of business accomplishment will translate into success in government.I', u'Indeed, Trump, the first billionaire businessman to win the White House, is broadly testing that proposition across his administration. ', u"He's tapped fast food executive Andy Puzder to lead the Labor Department, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross for Commerce, financier Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary and Goldman Sachs President Gary Cohn as his top economic adviser.B", u"But he's taking perhaps his biggest chance on Tillerson, pulling an executive from the rough-and-tumble world of oil production into the delicate arena of international diplomacy. ", u"If confirmed by the Senate   and his deep ties to Russia make that no sure thing   Tillerson will be at the center of discussions over the Syrian civil war, the intractable pursuit of peace in the Middle East, and potential conflicts with China, given Trump's early questioning of longstanding U.S. policy toward Beijing.T", u"To Trump, the deals Tillerson has struck around the world for Exxon, and the relationships he has built doing so, are ample preparation for the challenges he would face as the nation's top diplomat. ", u'While Tillerson\'s ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin are drawing scrutiny on Capitol Hill, Trump has had good things to say about Putin, too, and Tillerson\'s connection doesn\'t appear to have given him any pause."', u'"Rex knows how to manage a global enterprise, which is crucial to running a successful State Department, and his relationships with leaders all over the world are second to none," Trump said Tuesday.H', u"He's been making a similar case about himself all year as he sought to persuade voters that a real estate mogul and political novice had the skills to serve as president. ", u'He spent little time trying to show voters that his skills extended beyond the boardroom. ', u'Instead, he argued that experience was plenty.A', u'As Trump set about putting his administration together, people close to him say he was quickly drawn to the idea of elite business leaders filling the Cabinet, along with those who have had success in areas outside of politics. ', u"He's tapped three retired generals for top jobs: James Mattis to head the Pentagon, John Kelly for the Department of Homeland Security and Michael Flynn as his national security adviser.W", u"While business leaders have served in Cabinet posts under both Republican and Democratic presidents, the scope of private sector influence in Trump's burgeoning team is a stark contrast to modern predecessors. ", u"Most of President Barack Obama's Cabinet secretaries had public sector backgrounds, though Interior Secretary Sally Jewell served as CEO of the retail company REI and Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald is the retired CEO of Procter & Gamble.S", u"Some of Trump's picks have come from a more traditional mold. ", u'Among them will be former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has been asked by Trump to lead the Energy Department, according to people with knowledge of the decision. ', u'Trump has also selected a handful of congressional lawmakers for other top jobs.B', u'But Trump is said to have been particularly intrigued by the prospect of breaking the mold with his choice for secretary of state, one of the most powerful and prominent positions and one that often goes to a diplomatic veteran.T', u"Tillerson came to his attention several years ago when he beat back a motion supported by the Rockefellers   Exxon's founding family   that would have split the chairman and chief executive position into two different jobs.

', u'And the fact that the Russians were doing this was not an obsession? ', u'In the weeks leading up to the November election, WikiLeaks published a series of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and others.I', u'In October, 17 U.S. intelligence agencies, including the CIA, officially concluded that Russia was behind the hack that officials characterized as an attempt to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system.

', u'You had what was very clear relationships between members of the president-elect s campaign team and Russians, and a professed shared view on a bunch of issues. ', u'Obama continued:  The real question that I think we all have to reflect on is what s happened to our political system where some emails that were hacked and released ended up being the overwhelming story and the constant source of coverage, breathless coverage, that was depicted as somehow damning in all sorts of ways   when the truth of the matter was it was fairly routine stuff. ', u'The White House has faced bipartisan criticism for its apparent reluctance to respond forcefully to the Russian cyberattack. ', u'According to the Post, administration officials were  concerned about escalating tensions with Moscow and being accused of trying to boost Clinton s campaign  and ultimately advised against a counterattack.T', u'The president also addressed Trump s assertion that he doesn t need daily intelligence briefings because he s a  smart person  who doesn t  have to be told the same thing in the same words every single day for the next eight years.

[u'The leadership of the Los Angeles Times said two letters to the editor that the paper published on the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II should never have been published and did not meet their standards of  civil, fact-based discourse. ', u'Deirdre Edgar, who is the paper s  readers  representative,  explained Monday that many readers took issue with the letters that appeared in the travel section on Dec. 11. ', u'The letters employed cultural stereotypes to suggest that the mass internment of Japanese Americans during World War II was justified, and sought to minimize the hardships they endured,  Edgar wrote in an article posted Monday.T', u'The controversial letters were written in response to a Nov. 27 article about the Tule Lake and Manzanar relocation camps in California, where thousands of Japanese-Americans were detained.

', u'Hawes wrote: Japanese have an extremely strong attachment to family, and even more so back then.

[u'Airline travelers already upset about shrinking seats and rising fees should steel themselves for a potential new cabin reality: listening to another passenger yakking on a mobile phone.I', u'In a surprising and likely controversial step, U.S. aviation regulators on Thursday suggested they are leaning toward eventually allowing in-flight calls from airline passengers with two important caveats: airlines will have the option of whether to provide the service, and passengers must be informed well in advance if the flight allows calls.W', u'While the Transportation Department likely is years away from making a final decision, here s why it is stepping up its review and a change could happen: calls on trains, buses and subways already are commonplace, and advances in onboard Wi-Fi the technology enabling such calls miles above the Earth are improving call quality.T', u'The proposal won t become final until agency officials analyze what is likely to be a torrent of public comments, many expected to be strongly opposed to calls in closed cabins. ', u'Airlines also could veto the move, and DOT could decide to ban all such airborne communications.S', u'Some frequent fliers already are salivating at the prospect. ', u'I m going to start saving all my billing questions and help desk inquiries for the plane. ', u'My whole row can suffer with me on hold,  said Michael Greene, a Chicago-based sales specialist for GE Healthcare. ', u'We re all going to start learning a lot more about the people we get seated next to,  he said.P', u'Phone calls on some flights are technically possible now using in-flight Wi-Fi services provided by companies like Gogo Inc. and ViaSat Inc. Most Android and Apple smartphones are capable of calling over a Wi-Fi signal, and such calls also are possible via web-based Skype and Google Voice services. ', u'Federal restrictions and airline rules, however, outlaw such voice communications.C', u'Commuters on trains and buses already have cellular services available. ', u'In response, Amtrak and commuter railroads have introduced  quiet cars  to limit noise, including the din of cellphone conversations.G', u'Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign, a New York-based subway rider-advocacy group, says passengers have come to expect access to cell service at underground stations. ', u'It is viewed as  another miracle of daily commuting,  he said, adding passenger have grown accustomed to it. ', u'I don t think it made much difference to the riding public,  Mr. Russianoff said.I', u'In line with earlier comments by federal and industry officials suggesting widespread voice communications would pose unacceptable problems and privacy concerns for many passengers, the agency indicated it continues to mull whether to slap an outright ban on Wi-Fi-enabled phone calls affecting all flights through U.S. airspace, including foreign airlines serving U.S. cities.D', u'DOT began seeking public input on this topic more than two years ago, noting on Thursday that  a substantial majority of individual commenters expressed opposition to voice calls on the grounds that they are disturbing, particularly in the confined space of an aircraft cabin. ', u'Still, if some U.S. carriers conclude they can embrace the potential for additional revenue without alienating too many customers, Thursday s move could end up opening the door to optional services that over the years have been deemed highly objectionable by many fliers.N', u'Numerous airlines in Europe, parts of Asia and the Middle East offer voice communications. ', u'The U.S. now bans all conventional cellular systems. ', u'Historically, the ban was supposed to prevent interference with cellphone towers on the ground. ', u'But now, DOT is looking to establish rules for Wi-Fi systems that weren t covered by the original ban, and it is responding to consumer protection concerns rather than safety or interference issues.A', u'As onboard Wi-Fi becomes more widespread and powerful, DOT projects that phone calls via such technology are likely to improve in quality, even as they become less expensive and more of a draw for passengers.A', u'Against this changing backdrop, the DOT s proposed rule adopts an unusual legal point. ', u'It argues that making it possible for some passengers to chat on phones without providing adequate notice to others who unwittingly would hear those conversations may amount to an unfair and deceptive practice.T', u'The agency said officials believe  that consumers would be unfairly surprised and harmed if they learned only after the purchase of a ticket,  or even after boarding the aircraft, that the carrier permitted voice calls on flights.M', u'Much of the industry s immediate reaction was cautious. ', u'United Continental Holdings Inc. said it was reviewing the proposal  and will carefully evaluate the views of our customers and crew members on this topic. ', u'Previously, Delta Air Lines Inc. and JetBlue Airways Corp. said they intended to prohibit voice calls on their planes, regardless of regulatory action. ', u'American Airlines Group Inc., the nation s largest carrier by traffic, states as part of its Wi-Fi policies that passengers can purchase Wi-Fi aboard most of its domestic flights and internationally on its longest-range Boeing Co. 777 jets. ', u'But cellphone and other voice services aren t available with its in-flight Wi-Fi.T', u'The response from Charlie Leocha, chairman of travelers advocacy group Travelers United, was negative and adamant. ', u'The overwhelming feedback from passengers is that  nobody likes the concept of voice calls on planes,  he said. ', u'Nonetheless, some passengers already place voice calls via Skype or Google Voice and other technologies that use VOIP, or voice over internet protocols. ', u'The consumer advocate said he could see a situation where one airline would allow voice calls on certain routes to appeal to business travelers, robbing traffic from a competing airline on the same routes that banned the practice. ', u'The Association of Flight Attendants, a union representing 50,000 employees at 18 U.S. airlines, said anything short of banning all voice calls is  reckless,  adding that  it threatens aviation security and increases the likelihood of conflict in the skies. ', u'Flight attendants worry that loud conversations by passengers on any mobile device would lead to disruptions in the cabin. ', u'And they fear that passengers would grab their devices in emergencies, instead of listening to the attendants  safety instructions. ', u'But Airlines for America, the industry s leading trade group, was much less negative, saying it doesn t believe this is a matter for federal regulation. ', u'We believe airlines should be able to determine which services can be safely offered in flight and make those decisions based on what is in the best interests of their passengers and crew members,  a spokeswoman said.

[u"By David LawderWASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump is stacking his trade transition team with veterans of the U.S. steel industry's battles with China, signaling a potentially more aggressive approach to U.S. complaints of unfair Chinese subsidies for its exports and barriers to imports.L", u"Led by Wilbur Ross, a billionaire steel investor and Trump's nominee for commerce secretary, Dan DiMicco, the former CEO of steelmaker Nucor Corp, and three veteran steel trade lawyers, the team is expected to help shift the U.S. trade focus more heavily toward enforcement actions aimed at bringing down a chronic U.S. trade deficit, Washington trade experts said. ", u"Based on their past efforts, this could include more challenges to China's trade practices through the World Trade Organization and more U.S. government-initiated anti-dumping and anti-subsidy cases against a wider range of Chinese products.

', u"Ross, who advised Trump's presidential campaign on economic issues, has signaled he will use access to the lucrative U.S. consumer market as leverage to negotiate better trade terms. ", u"The United States is China's biggest export market. ", u'During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to levy a punitive 45-percent tariff on Chinese goods and label Beijing a currency manipulator. ', u'It is not clear though whether he will follow through on those threats once he takes office.

', u'The personal blog of DiMicco, meanwhile, gives some indication of how he would approach China if he was named head of USTR. ', u'He has accused China of waging a "mercantilist trade war" on the United States for two decades, through currency manipulation, unfair subsidies and intellectual property theft. ', u"On the issue of currency manipulation, many economists disagree, saying Beijing is no longer keeping its yuan artificially undervalued to make its exports cheap, citing the hundreds of billions of dollars in reserves it has spent to prop up the yuan's value this year. ", u"A key question for Trump's trade team is how far they can push China to change its trade practices without provoking a trade war that will hurt both countries. ", u'"If what they plan to do is get a little scratchier with China on enforcement within the existing WTO rules, that\'s OK," said Scott Miller, a China trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

H', u'He Weiwen, vice president at the Center for China and Globalization, a government-affiliated think-tank in Beijing, said any punitive action against China by the Trump administration would invite a retaliatory response. ', u'"We will certainly respond in the same way," he said, adding that Washington and Beijing "should find good solutions that are acceptable to both and not go to extremes. It will hurt both." C', u'Chinese state media have warned that any new tariffs imposed by Trump would lead to retaliation against Boeing aircraft, Apple iPhones and U.S. corn and soybeans.

', u'Trump announced that Tillerson, CEO of ExxonMobil, is his pick to run state in a tweet praising him as  one of the truly great business leaders of the world  Tuesday morning.B', u'Breitbart dug up the oil magnate s 2013 Wall Street Journal op-ed calling Common Core, an initiative launched by the National Governors Association, a  path to renewed competitiveness  for the U.S. ', u'Tillerson has a history of supporting policies opposite to many of the themes the president-elect highlighted during his campaign, including on Common Core education standards,  Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle wrote.O', u'Opposing Common Core was one of the few education issues Trump consistently touted on the campaign trail. ', u'He repeatedly promised to end Common Core if elected president. (He can t   states that voted to adopt the standards would have to individually repeal them.) The standards set guidelines for what concepts and skills students should know in math and language by the end of each grade, allowing each state that adopts them to determine the lesson plans and curriculum to reach that goal.T', u'The Obama administration poured funds into helping states create standardized tests aligned with Common Core; the administration also incentivized states to adopt the standards by making it easier for them to receive federal funds if they did.S', u'Some conservatives see the standards as a federal overreach into local control over education. ', u'Many homeschool advocates in particular are vehemently opposed to the standards.B', u'But Tillerson argued that Common Core would help the American workforce learn crucial math and technology skills they are currently lacking. ', u'He chided his home state of Texas for refusing to join the 45 states that adopted the Common Core standards in a speech in 2014. ', u'Tillerson said he was  extraordinarily disappointed  in Texas for refusing to adopt the standards. ', u'I don t think the [K-12] schools realize that we re their customer,  Tillerson said at a Business Roundtable meeting. ', u'They need to produce students with skills that allow them to get a job. ', u'If they don t, they are essentially producing a defective product. ', u'And in this case, the product is a human being. ', u'It s tragic. ', u'He also chided Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Corbett for delaying the implementation of the program in his state in 2013.C', u'Common Core may matter to many of Trump s supporters, but it s unlikely to be an issue in Tillerson s Senate confirmation. ', u'Some Republican senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, have expressed reservations about Tillerson s friendship with Russian leader Vladmir Putin, signaling he may face a tough path to nomination on entirely different grounds.C', u'Common Core has also been a flashpoint for Betsey DeVos, a Michigan billionaire who is Trump s Cabinet pick for education.D', u'DeVos is an advocate for private school vouchers and charter schools, and served as a board member for Jeb Bush s Foundation for Excellence in Education, a nonprofit that backs Common Core standards.A', u'After Trump announced his decision to appoint her to his Cabinet, Devos quickly disavowed any affiliation with the standards on Twitter and linked to a personal website explaining her views. ', u'Many of you are asking about Common Core. ', u'To clarify, I am not a supporter period. ', u'Read my full stance, here: https://t.co/qB2nAXvX0B   Betsy DeVos (@BetsyDeVos) November 23, 2016  Have organizations that I have been a part of supported Common Core?  she wrote. ', u'But that s not my position. ', u'Sometimes it s not just students who need to do their homework. ', u'Earlier this month, she appeared at Trump s  thank-you  rally in Michigan, again assuring Trump s supporters that she would  put an end to federalized Common Core. ', u'DeVos also criticized the media for spreading  false news  about her, without specifying which claims she believed were untrue.K', u'Karen Braun, an anti-Common Core activist, was unconvinced. ', u'She told Breitbart she was  not fooled  by DeVos  words. ', u'We know the truth,  Braun said. ', u'We experienced it first hand. ']

[u'WASHINGTON (AP)   A man inspired by an internet conspiracy theory to fire an assault weapon inside a pizza restaurant warned friends that his "raid" could involve killing people, according to court documents made public Tuesday.E', u"Edgar Maddison Welch, 28, of Salisbury, North Carolina, has been in jail since the Dec. 4 shooting at Comet Ping Pong, which has been targeted by purveyors and consumers of fake news who spread false rumors that it's the site of a child sex trafficking ring run by prominent Democrats.P", u'Prosecutors announced Tuesday that Welch now faces a federal charge of interstate transportation of a firearm with intent to commit a crime, punishable by up to 10 years in prison and potential financial penalties.L', u'Local charges of assault with a dangerous weapon and other weapons offenses were dismissed Tuesday, though they could be added to the federal case.

', u'He asked one friend if he had any Army buddies who might be "down for the cause?" which he described as "Raiding a pedo ring, possibly sacraficing (sic) the lives of a few for the lives of many," and standing up against "a corrupt system that kidnaps, tortures and rapes babies and children in our own backyard."Court documents suggest that the three friends met, and one planned to accompany Welch; after Welch\'s arrest became public, the person texted that Welch "ditched" him, a court document said. ', u'A court document also says Welch recorded a video on his phone on the day of the shooting, telling his family members that he loved them and expressing hopes that he would be able to tell them that again."', u'"And if not," he said, "don\'t ever forget it."Welch walked into the Comet Ping Pong restaurant carrying a .38 revolver in a holster on his hip and the AR-15 assault weapon across his chest "in a manner that instilled fear in everyone who saw him," the document said. ', u'Customers and employees fled, and when one worker unwittingly walked in through a rear door, Welch pointed his weapon at that employee, who also fled, the document says.T', u'The federal document says Welch said he fired at a locked door as he "searched for evidence of hidden rooms or tunnels, or child sex-trafficking of any kind." An earlier document, supporting the now-dismissed local charges, said Welch fired repeatedly, striking the walls, one door and a "computer desktop."Welch "surrendered peacefully when he found no evidence that underage children were being harbored in the restaurant," court documents have said. ', u'No one was hurt.H', u'His parents, Terri Welch and Harry Welch Jr., were in court on Tuesday, but declined to speak to an Associated Press reporter.T', u"They did speak with The Washington Post (http://wapo.st/2hxFSql) at their son's public defender's office on Monday, saying he shifted from energetic and outgoing to melancholy and quiet after he hit a 13-year-old pedestrian with his car in October.

We feel that accident changed him," Harry Welch said, and his wife said they have wondered whether it could have been a catalyst for the gun violence. ', u'The couple had not spoken with their son since the shooting.E', u"Edgar Welch's parents described him as loving and responsible, an affectionate father to two young girls, and so religious that he has two Bible verses, Isaiah 40:30-31, tattooed across his back.

', u'But it also determined no further action was warranted against Flynn, because he did not act  knowingly  and that  there was no actual or potential damage to national security as a result.

[u'When the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) detected a massive explosion in 2015, astronomers pored over the data and categorized the event as a superluminous supernova, the brightest-ever recorded in history, which was twice as bright as the second in the list. ', u'Called ASASSN-15lh, it was, at its peak, 20 times brighter than the light produced by the entire Milky Way galaxy.B', u'But now, it turns out it may not have been a supernova   an explosion, one of the last stages of the evolution of massive stars much bigger than the sun   at all. ', u'Instead, according to a statement on the website of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), it was something far more rare: a spinning black hole consuming a passing star.A', u'An international team led by Giorgos Leloudas at the Weizmann Institute of Science, Israel, studied the data recorded by ASAS-SN from the galaxy, about 4 billion light-years away, where the ASASSN-15lh event took place. ', u'We observed the source for 10 months following the event and have concluded that the explanation is unlikely to lie with an extraordinarily bright supernova. ', u'Our results indicate that the event was probably caused by a rapidly spinning supermassive black hole as it destroyed a low-mass star,  Leloudas said in the statement Monday.T', u'The supermassive black hole in his theory resides at the center of the galaxy where the event took place, and has an estimated mass of about 100 million times that of the sun. ', u'The star it consumed, meanwhile, had mass similar to our sun. ', u'This sort of event is called a tidal disruption event, and has been observed only about 10 times till date.R', u'Researchers speculate the reason why the black hole could attract the star even though it was initially beyond its event horizon is because it was a rapidly spinning black hole, and therefore the event horizon limit didn t apply to it.A', u'Additional data was collected using the Very Large Telescope at ESO s Paranal Observatory, the New Technology Telescope at ESO s La Silla Observatory and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope. ', u'Even with all the collected data we cannot say with 100% certainty that the ASASSN-15lh event was a tidal disruption event,  concludes Leloudas.

', u'They have what is called sense-and-avoid technology. ', u'That means, basically, seeing and then avoiding obstacles.T', u'These drones are more like horses than cars and let me explain why.

', u'But dampening the noise is one of them.D', u'DP: And how will you keep these drones from interfering with air travel?P', u'PM: Well, we ve proposed to regulators around the world, including the F.A.A', u'A., a certain kind of an airspace design that would keep the drones separated from the aircraft.W', u'We were thinking: Manned aircraft above 500 feet. ', u'Between 400 and 500 feet there d be a no-fly zone a safety buffer. ', u'Between 200 and 400 feet would be a transit zone, where drones could fly fairly quickly, horizontally.

', u'The realtors, for example, wouldn t need to fly above 200 feet to get a great shot at a house. ', u'DP: How have the F.A.A', u'A. and NASA reacted to this proposal?

', u'DP: How does this proposal, the layers idea, differ from what NASA s working on? ', u'PM: It s with a similar goal in mind. ', u'We presented this proposal at a NASA conference, and we re of the same mind. ', u'We need to figure out this airspace. ', u'DP: My impression is that the FAA and Amazon haven t exactly seen eye to eye on your plan. ', u'PM: In deference to the FAA., or in sympathy with the FAA, it turns out that they have a limited ability to regulate amateur drones, but they have full powers to regulate commercial drones. ', u'To my way of thinking, at least, that imbalance doesn t make sense. ', u'At the very least, they ought to be treated the same, to give the F.A.A', u'A. the same authority to regulate both amateur and commercial drones. ', u'Arguably, you would want to regulate the amateurs even more, because they have less training, their drones are less sophisticated, and so forth. ', u'So certainly that part of the law needs to be clarified, at a minimum. ', u'We believe that they must begin, in earnest, planning for the rules that are more sophisticated, that go to the kinds of operations that Amazon Prime Air will encompass.

[u'As part of Google s ongoing effort to make the switch from iOS to Android that much more seamless, the search giant recently introduced a new Google Drive feature designed to assist users who want to transfer their content over from their iPhone to an Android smartphone.T', u'The entire process is extremely straight forward as it simply uploads a user s important iOS data to Google s cloud whereupon the data is then pushed back down to a new Android device.

[u'The first river polluted by humanity may have been discovered in Jordan, contaminated by copper about 7,000 years ago, a new study finds.S', u'Scientists examined a now-dry riverbed in the Wadi Faynan region of southern Jordan. ', u'Archaeologist Russell Adams at the University of Waterloo in Canada and his colleagues have been studying the area for more than 25 years to learn more about a critical turning point in history   the origins of metallurgy, when humans began moving from making tools out of stones to making tools out of metal."', u'"The region is famous as one of the principal sites in the Middle East where copper occurs that can easily be mined," Adams told Live Science. [Photos of the World\'s 10 Most Polluted Places]Copper production began in this region during the Chalcolithic, or Copper Age, which took place between about 5000 and 3200 B.C. in this region, Adams said. ', u'The Chalcolithic Age was a transitional period during the late Neolithic, or Stone Age, and the beginning of the Bronze Age."', u'"These populations were experimenting with fire, experimenting with pottery and experimenting with copper ores, and all three of these components are part of the early production of copper metals from ores," Adams said in a statement. ', u'"The technological innovation and the spread of the adoption and use of metals in society mark the beginning of the modern world."This early copper production involved combining charcoal and the blue-green copper ore found in abundance in this area in pottery crucibles or vessels and heating the mixture over a fire. ', u'The process was time-consuming and labor-intensive, so it took thousands of years before copper became a central part of human societies, the researchers said.O', u'Over time, communities in the region grew larger and copper production expanded. ', u'People built mines and then large smelting furnaces and factories by about 2600 B.C., the researchers said."', u'"This region is home to the world\'s first industrial revolution," Adams said in the statement. ', u'"This really was the center of innovative technology."Among other things, Adams and his colleagues were interested in the long-term effects of copper production on the environment in this region. ', u'"There are places in the Wadi Faynan basin where the pollution from the copper smelting residues, the slag, are significant health risks, and probably would\'ve been that way for a long time," Adams said.T', u"The international research team's analysis of the sediments in the area suggested that pollution of a meandering stream that once ran in Wadi Faynan began about 7,000 years ago. ", u'"This is the earliest example known yet of humanity\'s pollution of the world," Adams said.T', u'The slag from copper production contained metals such as copper, lead, zinc, cadmium, and even arsenic, mercury and thallium. ', u'Plants absorbed these metals, and then people and animals such as goats and sheep ate them.P', u'Pollution from millennia of copper mining and production likely led to widespread health problems in the region, such as infertility, newborn malformations and premature death, Adams said. ', u'He said that prior work examining human bones from Roman cemeteries in the region "found unhealthy levels of metals in people, and these were not necessarily people involved in mining and smelting themselves   many were infants and juveniles. There was clearly uptake of environmental pollution into the food chain."Future research could look for signs of contamination in various parts of this region to learn more about how pollution in this area might have varied over time, Adams said.T', u'The scientists will detail their findings Dec. 15 in the journal Science of the Total Environment.O', u'Original article on Live Science.E', u"Editor's Recommendations"]

', u'Trump also plans to spend trillions of dollars on American infrastructure improvements in hopes of creating jobs while improving U.S. roads, bridges, and airports. ', u'Asked whether the president-elect s proposals influenced the rate hike, Yellen ,  Some of the participants, but not all of the participants, did incorporate some assumptions of the change in fiscal policy into their projections.

', u'He could  to renew her term, breaking tradition with the last three Fed chairs, who were all reappointed. ', u'The decision to raise rates, which was widely expected, was unanimous. ', u'Over the course of the last 10 years, the Fed has been reluctant to make cash more expensive because it feared it would be a disincentive to spend as the economy slowly recovered from the 2008 crash that threatened to sink the global economy. ', u'The Fed last raised interest rates a year ago. ', u'Before that, it was essentially free to borrow from the central bank. ', u'The Fed is also eyeing three more rate increases in 2017. ', u'That means that after a decade of free money, the central bank plans to make loans more expensive three times during Trump s first year in office. ', u'So far, Wall Street has cheered Trump s proposals. ', u'The Dow Jones industrial average is at its highest levels ever, flirting with 20,000 points. ', u'Deregulation and a more favorable tax code could compel businesses to spend some of the $1.4 trillion in cash they are currently  on, bolstering the overall economy.

[u'Apple s idea of fixing the reported battery issues with the brand new MacBook Pro is to eliminate a macOS feature that many MacBook users have relied on for years: the  time remaining  estimate that tells you how much time you can use your laptop before your battery runs out of juice.

[u"SAN FRANCISCO (AP)   Silicon Valley leaders were among Donald Trump's most outspoken opponents during the presidential campaign. ", u'On Wednesday, though, many of them will come face-to-face with the president-elect for the first time since the election.T', u"The tech industry had multiple concerns about candidate Trump, among them fears that he would stifle innovation, curb the hiring of computer-savvy immigrants and infringe on consumers' digital privacy. ", u"Those worries may not have abated, but that's not stopping technology leaders from heading to Trump Tower in New York to make their peace   or press their case   with Trump and his advisers.T", u"The CEOs planning to attend include Apple's Tim Cook, Alphabet's Larry Page, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Intel's Brian Krzanich, IBM's Ginni Rometty, Oracle's Safra Catz and Cisco Systems' Chuck Robbins.F", u"Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, will be on hand instead of its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, who was one of many tech executives to express misgivings about Trump's pledge to deport millions of immigrants.T", u'TRUMPIt could be a prickly meeting.N', u'No other industry was more open in its contempt for Trump during the campaign. ', u'In an open letter published in July, more than 140 technology executives, entrepreneurs and venture capitalists skewered Trump as a "disaster for innovation."And Trump\'s denigration of Mexicans, his pledge to deport millions of immigrants now living in the U.S. illegally, and his crude remarks about women were widely viewed as racist, authoritarian and sexist by an industry that prides itself on its tolerance.T', u'Trump, in turn, sometimes lashed out at the industry and its leaders.H', u'He lambasted Bezos for the campaign coverage of his newspaper, The Washington Post, and suggested that Amazon could face antitrust scrutiny if he were elected.T', u"Trump also rebuked Cook for fighting a government order requiring Apple to unlock an encrypted iPhone used by a shooter in last year's terrorist attack in San Bernardino, California.A", u"And Trump's repeated screeds against immigrants raised fears that he might dismantle programs that have enabled tech companies to hire tens of thousands of foreign workers with the skills to write computer programs, design web pages and build mobile apps.T", u'The industry is also worried that Trump might try to undermine "net neutrality," a regulation requiring internet service providers to offer equal access to all online services. ', u"Trump's harsh characterization of the media as dishonest and unfair has raised other fears that he might even try to restrict free speech online.O", u'OUT OF STRIFE, PEACE?S', u"Some in Silicon Valley think the industry's best move would be to keep its distance until Trump changes his tone. ", u'Former Google executive Chris Sacca, now a tech investor, argues that industry leaders should steer clear of the meeting altogether.S', u'Sitting down with the president-elect "would only make sense after Trump has given public assurances he won\'t encourage censorship, will stop exploiting fake news, will promote net neutrality, denounce hate crimes, and embrace science," Sacca said. ', u'"If and until then, tech figures who visit are being used to whitewash an authoritarian bully who threatens not just our industry, but our entire democracy."Most of the companies with executives attending Wednesday\'s meeting declined to comment ahead of the gathering.I', u"In an article published in USA Today, IBM's Rometty indicated she intended to press Trump to introduce more educational programs to teach people the skills needed to fill technology jobs   a key issue for most industry leaders. ", u"Rometty says IBM plans to hire 25,000 workers during Trump's four-year term, including 6,000 next year.O", u'Oracle\'s Catz said in a statement that she plans to tell Trump "that we are with him and are here to help in any way we can. If he can reform the tax code, reduce regulation, and negotiate better trade deals, the U.S. technology community will be stronger and more competitive than ever." O', u'Other tech institutions are also signaling an end to the animosity. ', u'The Internet Association, a trade group whose members include Google, Facebook and Amazon, praised Trump in an open letter last month for his use of Twitter and other digital tools to help him get elected. ', u"The letter also appealed to Trump's emphasis on the economy, citing statistics estimating that the internet sector accounted for nearly $1 trillion of the country's gross domestic product. ", u"Some conservatives say they're actually worried that Trump might get too friendly with tech. ", u'Peter Flaherty, the president of the National Legal and Policy Center, charges that big technology companies exploited their close relationship with President Barack Obama "to feather their nests and push for policies that benefit them at the expense of the American worker." T', u'Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said by email that the president-elect "looks forward to meeting with this important group of industry leaders and true innovators." C', u'COMMON GROUND: TAX CUTS T', u"The technology industry already supports one of Trump's ideas. ", u'He has promised to temporarily reduce the corporate tax on foreign profits from the current 35 percent to 10 percent to give U.S. companies an incentive to bring their overseas cash back home. ', u"It's a cut that Cook has been pushing Congress to make because Apple has $216 billion, or 91 percent of its total cash, in overseas accounts. ", u"Other tech companies in line to benefit the most from a tax reduction include Microsoft, Cisco, Microsoft and Google's corporate parent, Alphabet. ", u'But Trump might not be doing many other favors for technology companies given his history of holding grudges against his opponents, said Larry Irving, a former government affairs executive for Hewlett-Packard who now runs a consulting firm. ', u'"Everything Trump has done so far suggests that he rewards loyalty and punishes disloyalty," Irving said. ', u'"The tech industry better have some pontoons ready."']

[u'Uber, the quintessential disrupter, has standard method of crashing into a new market: set up shop with low prices and zero permits for drivers; get the locals hooked on cheap cab rides; strong-arm the local government into legalizing ridesharing, and then slowly raise prices to make profit and pay for the taxes it starts paying.I', u'It s a classic innovate first, ask permission later policy, and it s worked in Montreal, Paris, New York, and basically anywhere else Uber has expanded.

', u'It has been in place for years, and requires companies to seek approval before tests. ', u'It also requires those companies to issue monthly and yearly reports on progress, including data on any crashes or times that a human operator had to take control.D', u'Despite 20 other self-driving car companies having no problems with these basic regulations, Uber decided that the law doesn t apply to it. ', u'In a blog post, Uber uses faulty logic to argue that it doesn t need a permit: Finally, we understand that there is a debate over whether or not we need a testing permit to launch self-driving Ubers in San Francisco. ', u'We have looked at this issue carefully and we don t believe we do. ', u'Before you think,  there they go again  let us take a moment to explain: First, we are not planning to operate any differently than in Pittsburgh, where our pilot has been running successfully for several months.

', u'For us, it s still early days and our cars are not yet ready to drive without a person monitoring them. (Emphasis mine)Uber is saying that because its cars aren t ready to drive without human supervision, they don t count as autonomous vehicles. ', u'Never mind that Uber itself describes the test vehicles as  Self-Driving Ubers,  and they absolutely meet the definition of an autonomous vehicle that the DMV uses, that an  Autonomous vehicle  means any vehicle equipped with autonomous technology that has been integrated into that vehicle, excepting collision-avoidance systems like automatic braking.U', u'Uber is doing exactly the same kind of testing that Google has been conducting for years, but it s now using a technicality to say the rules don t apply to it. ', u'It might be that the permitting process would slow down Uber s development; equally likely is that Uber doesn t want to publicly disclose data on crashes or disengagements of the self-driving tech.E', u'Either way, it seems clear that this is just another case of Uber moving first, and dealing with pesky regulations later. ', u'It s even more clear-cut in this case, because normally Uber is arguing that it is operating a ridesharing service rather than a taxi service, so any laws applicable to the taxi industry don t apply to its fleet of non-employees.B', u'But in this case, Uber is taking a law that was specifically designed for self-driving car testing, and saying that it doesn t apply to its own self-driving car program because of a technicality in language.T', u'To its credit, the Californian DMV isn t having any of it. ', u'In a statement, the DMV doesn t pull punches: We have a permitting process in place to ensure public safety as this technology is being tested.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   There's more hustle than hope behind an effort to derail Donald Trump's presidency in the Electoral College.R", u'Republican electors are being swamped with pleas to buck tradition and cast ballots for someone else at meetings across the country Monday that are on course to ratify Trump as the winner. ', u'AP interviews with more than 330 electors from both parties found little appetite for a revolt.W', u"Whether they like Trump or not, and some plainly don't, scores of the Republicans chosen to cast votes in the state-capital meetings told AP they feel bound by history, duty, party loyalty or the law to rubber-stamp their state's results and make him president. ", u'Appeals numbering in the tens of thousands   drowning inboxes, ringing cellphones, stuffing home and office mailboxes with actual handwritten letters   have not swayed them.T', u'The interviews found widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the rush of anti-Trump maneuvering can stop him. ', u'For that to happen, Republican-appointed electors would have to stage an unprecedented defection.S', u'Still, people going to the typically ho-hum electoral gatherings have been drawn into the rough and tumble of campaign-season politics. ', u'Republicans are being beseeched to revolt in a torrent of lobbying, centered on the arguments that Clinton won the popular vote and that Trump is unsuited to the presidency. ', u'Most of it is falling on deaf ears, but it has also led to some acquaintances being made across the great political divide."', u'"Let me give you the total as of right now: 48,324 emails about my role as an elector," said Brian Westrate, a small-business owner and GOP district chairman in Fall Creek, Wisconsin. ', u'"I have a Twitter debate with a former porn star from California asking me to change my vote. It\'s been fascinating."Similarly deluged, Republican elector Hector Maldonado, a Missouri National Guardsman, has taken the time to console one correspondent, a single mother and Air Force veteran who is beside herself with worry about what a Trump presidency will mean."', u'"Everything\'s going to be OK," he said he told her. ', u'"I know you\'re scared, but don\'t worry. Everything\'s going to be OK. And I know that it will be."Maldonado, a Mexican immigrant and medical-equipment seller in Sullivan, Missouri, backed Ted Cruz in the primaries but will cast his vote for Trump with conviction. ', u'"I took an oath once to become a U.S. citizen," he said, "and on Aug. 14, 1995, that was the first oath that I\'ve taken to support the U.S. Constitution. A year later I took the oath again, to support the duties of being an officer in the U.S. Army. This was the third oath that I\'ve taken to execute what I promised to do."Even a leader of the anti-Trump effort, Bret Chiafalo of Everett, Washington, calls it a "losing bet"   but one he says the republic\'s founders would want him to make. ', u'"I believe that Donald Trump is a unique danger to our country and the Founding Fathers put the Electoral College in place to, among other things, stop that from happening," said Chiafalo, 38, an Xbox network engineer who backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries.I', u'It takes 270 electoral votes to make a president.

', u'"Hell will freeze and we will be skating on the lava before I change," he said. ', u'"He won the state and I\'ve pledged and gave my word that that\'s what I would do. And I won\'t break it."Nor will Jim Skaggs, 78, a developer from Bowling Green, Kentucky, despite deep concern about Trump. ', u'"His personality worries me," Skaggs said. ', u'"He is not open-minded." Skaggs knew Trump\'s father through the construction business, met the son in his 20s, and "I wasn\'t impressed.""I hope he is far better than I think he is," Skaggs said. ', u'Even so, "I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump," he said. ', u'"I think it\'s a duty."State law and practices vary for electors, but even in states where electors don\'t take an oath to vote a certain way or don\'t face legal ramifications for stepping out of line, the heavy expectation is for them to ratify the results. ', u'As much as they don\'t want Trump in office, some Democrats are as reluctant as Republicans to go rogue."', u'"We lost the election," said John Padilla of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a Democratic ward chairman. ', u'"That\'s how elections are and you shake hands with your opponent and you get on with what you have to do and support your candidate."Yet Democratic electors, stung by losing an election to a Republican who trails Clinton by more than 2.6 million votes nationwide, spoke strongly in the interviews in favor of overhauling or throwing out the electoral system. ', u'Republican electors generally supported it, reasoning that it provides a counterweight to political dominance by coastal states with huge, and largely Democratic, populations, like California and New York.C', u'Chiafalo is a co-founder of the Hamilton Electors, a group formed to steer other electors from both parties to a third candidate.

', u'Now,  has some horrifying details on exactly how Russian hackers were able to break into the systems, and they illustrate some important lessons we could all stand to learn.A', u"According to The New York Times, the Russian cyberinvasion of the DNC's servers took place in two stages, but the second and most severe breach happened in mid-March when Hillary Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta's private email account was hacked after he clicked on a phishing email, a fake correspondence purportedly from Google but actually from hackers, one designed to trick the recipient into revealing a password.T", u'The Times got a look at the same attack as directed at another Clinton campaign official, Billy Rinehart. ', u"A full color image, as opposed to plain text as leaked with the rest of John Podesta's emails:The attack referenced by the email is all but certainly fictitious, whereas the real attack is the big blue button, which does not actually lead to Google's but instead to an attacker's where all information will be intercepted. ", u"And as far as phishing emails go, it's pretty good! ", u'There are no obvious misspellings or other blatant errors that might expose the ruse. ', u'Never ever change your password using a link from an unsolicited in-bound email. ', u'The full leaked emails from Wikileaks reveal two important details: the address the email came from, and the link the button pointed to. ', u"In the case of most phishing attacks, these are the most obvious points where a hacker's illusions slip. ", u'Unable to use an actual @google.com email address or official Google website, hackers can only opt for rough approximations. ', u'In this case, the email came from "no-reply@accounts.googlemail.com" and the link in the email was obscured by the link-shortening service Bit.ly.W', u"What's worse is that, according to the report, one aide actually singled out the email as suspect, but another confirmed it to be legitimate, in what he now says was actually a typo. ", u'Per  "This is a legitimate email," Charles Delavan, a Clinton campaign aide, replied to another of Mr. Podesta\'s aides, who had noticed the alert. ', u'"John needs to change his password immediately."With another click, a decade of emails that Mr. Podesta maintained in his Gmail account - a total of about 60,000 - were unlocked for the Russian hackers. ', u'Delavan, in an interview, said that his bad advice was a result of a typo: He knew this was a phishing attack, as the campaign was getting dozens of them. ', u'He said he had meant to type that it was an "illegitimate" email, an error that he said has plagued him ever since. ', u'Changing the password is generally not a bad idea when you are worried someone may be attempting to attack your account, but it was the method by which it was done-clicking the big blue button-that was the grave error. ', u"If there's one bit of useful, personal advice to come out of this whole mess it is this: Never ever change your password using a link from an unsolicited in-bound email. ", u'Instead, go to the website directly to start the process there, and do it on another device if you want to be extra careful.C', u"Chances are there is not an entire presidential election at stake in your case, but it's an important thing for all of us to learn.Y", u'You Might Also Like']

[u'BEIJING (AP)   China appears to have installed anti-aircraft and anti-missile weapons on its man-made islands in the strategically vital South China Sea, a U.S. security think tank says, upping the stakes in what many see as a potential Asian powder keg.T', u"The Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS, said in a report late Wednesday that the anti-aircraft guns and close-in weapons systems designed to guard against missile attack have been placed on all seven of China's newly created islands.W", u'White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Thursday that he could not confirm the report, but Republican Sen.

[u'The population of the United States is more diverse than ever, yet with each new Cabinet appointment announced by President-elect Donald Trump, his proposed administration looks  poised to become one of the whitest White Houses in recent history.W', u'With his core team in place   Vice President Mike Pence, chief of staff Reince Priebus, national security adviser Mike Flynn and chief strategist Steve Bannon   Trump is already guaranteed to enter the Oval Office surrounded by white men.T', u'The rest of Trump s Cabinet appointments must first be confirmed by the Senate. ', u'But of the 18 people he s already picked for the top roles requiring Senate approval, 14 are white and of those, 12 are also male. ', u'Ben Carson, the retired neurosurgeon and former presidential candidate tapped for secretary of housing and urban development, is so far the only black appointee. ', u'None of Trump s choices have been Latino.I', u'It s worth noting that there appears to be more diversity within Trump s small pool of female appointees than in his entire cast of Cabinet picks.S', u'South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who s been selected for the role of U.N. ambassador, is the daughter of Sikh immigrants from India, while Elaine Chao, Trump s pick for transportation secretary, was 8 years old when she and her family immigrated to the U.S. from their native Taiwan.O', u'One of the few Trump appointees whose r sum  includes government experience, Chao served as labor secretary for eight years under President George W. Bush, making her the first Asian-American woman to receive a cabinet position. ', u'She is also married to Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has refused to recuse himself from his wife s confirmation hearings.T', u'Trump has also nominated health policy consultant Seema Verma to be administrator of Medicare and Medicaid services, a role within the department of health and human services. ', u'Verma, whose parents are Indian immigrants, designed Indiana s Obamacare Medicaid expansion program.T', u'The other two women who ve been named for lead Cabinet roles are former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO Linda McMahon, Trump s choice for small business administrator, and education activist Betsy DeVos, who has been selected for education secretary.T', u'The whiteness of the Trump White House is particularly striking when compared against the outgoing administration, which has been deemed the most diverse in history.A', u'According to an analysis by Bloomberg Politics this week, 52 percent of the confirmed appointees to President Obama s first cabinet were white, as compared to 72 percent of George W. Bush s first confirmed Cabinet and 82 percent of those already selected by Trump.T', u'Trump s White House will likely be slightly less male-dominated than Bush s, with men making up 83 percent of W s first confirmed Cabinet versus 76 percent of Trump s nominees so far.T', u'Trump still has a chance to make his first presidential Cabinet slightly less homogeneous with his choices for secretary of agriculture, veterans affairs, director of the Office of Management and Budget, and U.S. trade representative.H', u'However, with the selection this week of Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson for secretary of state (if he is confirmed), Trump is officially on track to have the four most powerful departments   defense, justice, treasury and state   run by white men for the first time in 24 years.']

[u'Donald Trump said a lot of things about a lot of people on his journey to the White House. ', u'He mocked a war hero for getting captured. ', u'He accused a rival s dad of consorting with President Kennedy s killer. ', u'He likened another opponent   soon to be a member of his Cabinet   to a child molester.B', u'But nothing Trump unleashed during the campaign reverberated through Washington s vast governing apparatus like the 14-word sentence released by his transition team this week, after intelligence agencies issued their finding that the Russians had tried to intervene in our election   a charge that Trump, betraying more than a little insecurity, dismissed as  ridiculous  and politically motivated. ', u'These are the same people,  the statement read,  that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. ', u'Capital insiders were horrified that Trump would brutalize the nation s top spies in the same way he went after Marco Rubio or Ted Cruz   and this after refusing to sit for intelligence briefings. ', u'They shouldn t have been.B', u'Because all Trump did, really, was to acknowledge the subtext of his own political ascent. ', u'If there s one thing that enabled his assault on the country s governing and media establishments, it s the calamitous series of events that began in September 2001. ', u'Trump could never sail on with such impunity were it not for the invasion of Iraq and everything that followed.B', u'By now it should be clear: He is the vehicle of our reckoning.T', u'There was a time, not long ago, when it was possible to believe that no one would pay a very steep price for that cascade of failure during the Bush years, when just about every trusted institution in American life seemed to collapse of its own dereliction.D', u'Disgraced pundits kept on pontificating. ', u'The CIA kept right on stonewalling   successfully   to keep its history of torture sealed off from public view. ', u'The parties in Washington kept on fighting like spoiled brats. ', u'The bankers kept on making money and loaning it out.A', u'A decade passed, and American voters seemed to have settled into their cynicism, in the same way baseball fans still filled the stadiums after the steroid debacle and Catholic parishioners still lined the pews after coming to terms with chronic abuse.B', u'But politics is like that. ', u'The larger the shock to the system, the longer it takes for the effects to surface. ', u'Pain and resentment ricochet through the years, rattle around in the culture, until all at once the ground beneath us opens.Y', u'You can see now how the assassination of John Kennedy and the plunge into Vietnam in the 1960s touched off a series of events   the Great Society, civil unrest, a conservative backlash   that ultimately culminated in the Reagan Revolution of 1980.A', u'As I ve written, the full effect of Watergate wasn t apparent until more than a decade after Richard Nixon resigned, when, seemingly overnight, our presidential campaigns became almost entirely about character and morality.S', u'So it was with the searing events that followed the turn of the century   the terrorist attacks of 2001, the ill-advised invasion of Iraq in 2003, the implosion of Wall Street in 2008. ', u'Historians will note the improbable rise of Barack Obama and the revolt of the tea party   both representing historic challenges to their party establishments   as tremors before the quake.T', u'The ground was no longer stable, but those of us who spent our lives around politics were too familiar with the landscape, too informed by our own experience, to really feel the shift.T', u'Trump was not.A', u'And so, right from the start, he was willing to trash the powerful institutions of our civic life in a way that none of us thought survivable. ', u'The more he did it, the baser and cruder he became, the stronger he got.G', u'Generals were stupid. ', u'Judges were biased by their ethnicity. ', u'Bankers were venal. ', u'His own party was weak and pathetic.T', u'Trump understood how little respect any of these institutions still engendered. ', u'He understood that when he turned the debate stage into a coarse reality show, mocking his rivals  faces and boasting about his genitalia, he was essentially breaking the fourth wall of our politics. ', u'He was signaling to the viewers that he knew what they knew, which is that this whole business of governing was third-rate performance. ', u'Of course, Trump at least tepidly backed the Iraq War too, no matter how much he now says he didn t. He benefited mightily from the housing bust. ', u'And every time he lied outright about that or something else, we jumped up and down and shouted as if the place were on fire. ', u'Surely this was the end. ', u'But Trump had figured out that no one really believed the elite media anymore   the same media that said Iraq was an existential threat, that the banks had to be saved, that Obama would transform our dysfunctional politics. ', u'The same media that nightly featured a cavalcade of smug morons whose only qualification to opine on TV was an almost pathological shamelessness. ', u'The Bushes, history s last heirs to the 20th century Republican establishment, can hole up in Texas and Florida and shake their heads at all of this, disgusted by the assault on institutions that once were sacrosanct. ', u'But it works only because George W. imperiled those institutions to the point where Americans couldn t care less how much you abuse or disregard them. ', u'Does Trump really share in the vast contempt he channels? ', u'Apparently not. ', u'If he really thought generals were stupid, he wouldn t have chosen three of them for his Cabinet (and it probably would have been four, if that hadn t seemed, even to Trump, too close to a junta). ', u'If he really disdained Wall Street, he wouldn t have picked the president of Goldman Sachs to advise him on the economy, along with another firm alumnus to run the Treasury Department. ', u'If he really thought the media was so irrelevant, he wouldn t rush to his computer at night, when he s supposed to be planning for the hardest job on the planet, so he can tweet:  Just watched NBC News   So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point. ', u'Just can t get much worse, although @CNN is right up there! ', u'No, Trump is a pure opportunist, a pitch-perfect crooner of whatever note resonates. ', u'And my guess is that he ll keep on with all of it   the indictments, the insults, the demonstrably false narratives   until someone proves there s a cost. ', u'Because this is what he learned from his first-ever campaign experience   that if you pit yourself against powerful agencies or politicians or a corrupt media, people now will believe almost anything. ', u'Or maybe they won t really care what you re saying, as long as it s infuriating to the so-called experts. ', u'All of us in Washington can find this appalling and scary, but we created the opening through our own negligence. ', u'And looking back now, it was crazy to think we d somehow get away with it.

[u'Brittany Sherwood was only 15 when she had an abortion after becoming pregnant the first time she ever engaged in sex. ', u'Now in her late 20s, she says she felt the procedure was her only  real choice. ', u'Looking back, I m proud of myself for having the insight to know that I would never be able to give up the child for adoption following a pregnancy and birth,  said Sherwood, who is now a mental health nurse practitioner in southern Florida.S', u'Sherwood s emotional response to her abortion decision falls in line with a new study from the University of California at San Francisco, which found that women who underwent an abortion were at less risk of adverse mental health effects (such as depression, anxiety, and dissatisfaction of life) than those who were denied an abortion because their pregnancy was further along than the facility s gestational limit.T', u'The study s conclusion defies the argument of many abortion protesters   that women who undergo the procedure experience long-term psychological trauma.T', u'The lead author of the study, Antonia Biggs, told Yahoo News that the findings add to a growing body of research that indicates abortion does not lead to negative mental health outcomes for women. ', u'These data indicate that women should be trusted to make their own decisions regarding their reproductive lives,  said Biggs.T', u'The analysis, which is part of a larger body of reproductive research known as the Turnaway Study, is based on the experiences of nearly 1,000 women who sought abortions between 2008 and 2010 from 30 abortion facilities in 21 states. ', u'The ongoing research is intended to examine the effects of unintended pregnancy in women s lives. ', u'There should be well-informed, respectful and open discourse between those of us making the life-altering decision,  said Sherwood. ', u'We do a disservice to all women when we are not open about the decision we were faced with, the factors that we considered, and the emotions following the decision at different points in our lives. ', u'The study s findings come at a crucial time for abortion laws in the U.S., as President-elect Donald Trump has promised to fill Antonin Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court with a justice who is an opponent of abortion. ', u'Abortion foes have become newly emboldened by threats from Trump and the Republican Party to overturn Roe v. ', u'Wade, and some states are adding new limits on abortions. ', u'Most recently, Ohio made headlines for banning abortions after 20 weeks, while Texas adopted amendments that require the burial or cremation of fetal remains every time a woman has an abortion.A', u'About half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended, according to the Centers for Disease Control, and of all unintended pregnancies, about four in 10 are aborted. ', u'Three out of 10 women in the country will have an abortion by the time they are 45 years old, according to Planned Parenthood. ', u'In 2013, a total of 664,435 legally induced abortions were reported to the CDC from 49 reporting areas. ', u'The rate of abortion procedures has steadily decreased since 1980.B', u'But the National Right to Life Committee, the nation s largest anti-abortion advocacy organization, cites information contradictory to the study s finding on its website, referencing a 1989 congressional  Hearing on Impact of Abortion  to make the case for adverse mental health outcomes after an abortion: Researchers on the after-effects of abortion have identified a pattern of psychological problems known as Post-Abortion Syndrome (PAS). ', u'Women suffering PAS may experience drug and alcohol abuse, personal relationship disorders, sexual dysfunction, repeated abortions, communications difficulties, damaged self-esteem, and even attempt suicide.B', u'By studying women s experiences with receiving and being denied an abortion, the Turnaway study provides the best evidence we have to date on the true effects of abortion on women, Biggs said. ', u'Another notable result showed that women who received first-trimester abortions were affected in the same was as those ending pregnancies after three months. ', u'The findings do not support policies that restrict women s access to abortion on the basis that abortion harms women s mental health,  the authors wrote in a summary analysis. ', u'Policymakers now have conclusive evidence indicating that abortion does not harm women,  said Biggs. ', u'These data should be used to inform policies, so that we can ensure that women receive the most accurate and up-to-date information. ', u'Currently, 35 states require that women receive counseling before an abortion is performed, and 27 of these states require that women wait a specified amount of time   usually 24 hours   between the counseling and the abortion procedure, according to the Guttmacher Institute. ', u'Fourteen of those states require that counseling be provided in person and that the counseling take place before the waiting period begins, therefore requiring two separate trips to the facility.T', u'Twenty-two states require that a woman be informed about the emotional or psychological effects of abortion, and nine of those states specifically require going over negative psychological responses and stress. ', u'Our results indicate that laws in some states mandating that women be counseled on the negative psychological effects of abortion are not based on evidence,  said Biggs.E', u'Expanding access to abortion, rather than restricting it, is more protective of women s psychological well-being, she added.S', u'Sherwood, who is a proponent of women speaking openly about abortion, echoed Biggs s sentiments, stating that there should be more factual, honest conversation about the decision to undergo an abortion. ', u'This can be a life-altering decision, and you deserve to know how others before you made it,  she said. ', u'You deserve to know what each choice entails. ']

[u'About 2,000 years ago, when science was nowhere near as advanced as it is today, when people hadn t crossed the seemingly endless oceans separating the continents and observation of Earth from an external vantage point was impossible, most civilizations around the world believed the planet to be a flat surface, often depicted as a plane covered by a circular dome of the sky.T', u'This conception, which held Earth to be a flat surface, is called the flat Earth theory.

[u"'Lucy,' the ancient early human relation, may have shared her male mate with other females, according to recent research.R", u'Researchers from Universities in Italy and Tanzania discovered that Lucy s fellow species might have been polygynous, according to their findings that were published Wednesday in eLife Sciences.L', u'Lucy was one of the earliest descendants of the human species, at 3.2 million years, and belonged to a group of upright-walking beings known as Australopithecus afarensis.

Afarensis members. ', u'The location where the most recently uncovered footprints were found is now dubbed site S.A leading author of the study, Fidelis Masao, and the team were able to determine that one of the prints belonged to a male and that the others belonged to a female, which was determined by the differences in size between the sets prints. ', u'The researchers were able to gauge the full size and weight of the two members. ', u'Males were significantly larger than the females, and this male was believed to have been around 5-foot-6, while the female was likely about 4-foot-10. ', u'The difference in size between the sexes is important to note, as prior research has suggested that polygynous groups, could have included larger males, an evolutionary trait that developed when males attempted to win the attraction of other female mates.T', u'The new prints, when compared with the older prints found in 1978, lead to the  tentative conclusion  that a group of A. Afarensis members could have been traveling through the area together, Live Science reported. ', u'The group, one researcher considered, could have been comprised of "one male, two or three females, and one or two juveniles."The newly discovered sets of prints leave the researchers optimistic that more fossilized, or ichnofossils, could still be uncovered in the area, giving way to more clues about the hominins  lives. ', u'For me, the most important implication is that the area might harbor more ichnofossils   knowledge that could be used to solve many problems regarding different aspects of hominins,  Fidelis Masao, the leading author of the study and a paleolithic archaeologist at the Tanzanian University of Dar es Salaam, told Live Science.R', u'Related Articles']

[u'Washington (AFP) - The 2013 hack affecting a billion Yahoo users shows how seemingly innocuous bits of data gleaned from cyber attacks can be exploited for espionage and information warfare, as well as for profit.T', u'The breach, disclosed Wednesday, is the largest on record and comes just months after Yahoo disclosed a separate attack in 2014 affecting data from 500 million users.O', u'On the surface, the trove of data is "a bunch of junk," said John Dickson of the security consultancy Denim Group.B', u'But the ability to create a searchable database with data tidbits such as birth dates and phone numbers makes it enormously valuable to hackers seeking to make a profit or engage in industrial or state espionage, he said."', u'"If you\'re trying to research and get information about a target, you\'re going to use everything you can find," said Dickson, a former officer in the Air Force Information Warfare Center.T', u'The Yahoo hack did not collect credit card or Social Security numbers, according to the company, leading some analysts to speculate that the goals were not financial."', u'"For someone using data as a weapon, this is of tremendous value," said Steve Grobman, chief technical officer at Intel Security.- Information warfare? -James Scott, a senior fellow at the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a cybersecurity think tank, said that while details are still unknown, the attack could fuel disinformation campaigns by governments.S', u'Scott noted that the data had not appeared for sale on Deep Web markets -- that is, in murky corners of the web that cannot be reached by standard search engines."', u'"And since a significant number of victims (if any) have not reported identity theft resulting from the incident, there is a strong likelihood that the breach was not conducted for monetary gain," Scott said."', u'"This could indicate that the breach was an espionage stage of an information warfare effort."The disclosure of the breach comes amid intense scrutiny of cybersecurity in the US election campaign and of the potential impact of hacked email accounts from people close to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.U', u'US officials have claimed Russia was behind the attack aimed at disrupting the election.O', u'One of the hacks was a Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. ', u'Media reports say he or an assistant was fooled by a fake email that prompted him to reveal his password.S', u'Security analysts say such attacks are often preceded by lengthy data-gathering campaigns that might look for personal information such as a birth date or former school or university.- Signs of a state actor -Yahoo said it was not clear who was behind the billion-user hack but that some evidence pointed to "the same state-sponsored actor" believed responsible for the previously disclosed cyber attack.T', u'The security firm InfoArmor said in September that its analysis of the first breach indicated "professional" hackers stole the Yahoo data, and only later sold it to a state entity. ', u'InfoArmor said at the time that the breach "opens the door to significant opportunities for cyber espionage and targeted attacks to occur." G', u'Grobman said some attackers may mix real data with manipulated information to distort facts, creating further confusion and mistrust. ', u'"One of the things we are concerned about is that the public is conditioned to see leaked data as legitimate, and this data can be manipulated," Grobman said. ', u"Some analysts argue that the hackers' goals may be more financial than political. ", u'Security researcher Graham Cluley said certain bits of information such as phone numbers could be of value to criminals. ', u'"If a hacker or scammer has your telephone number, they can ring you up and trick you into believing they are an organization you already have a relationship with, which means that you might be tempted to hand over more personal information," Cluley said in a YouTube posting. - \'A lot of money\' - J', u'James Lewis, a senior fellow specializing in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said new analytics tools can sift through databases for political espionage purposes, but that it is not clear if Russia has those capabilities. ', u'"If you\'re a criminal, you would think you could monetize a billion accounts," Lewis said. ', u'"Even if you got a penny or a dime for each, you would still be making a lot of money." T', u'The attacks also pose a threat to the future of Yahoo, the former internet star which has seen its fortunes decline and is in the process of selling its main assets to telecom group Verizon. ', u'Dickson said that it\'s likely that "Verizon is doing a double take" on the $4.8 billion deal. ', u'"If this kills that deal, I think it will increase the focus on cybersecurity hygiene across the board," he said.']

', u'Why does a  self-driving  car need two drivers? ', u'First, California law prevents autonomous vehicles from operating without a human in the driver s seat. ', u'Then, a second person will ride along in the passenger seat to help record and analyze data during each trip to help improve Uber s self-driving technology.U', u'Uber first announced its new self-driving ride-hailing initiative three months ago.

[u"Washington (AFP) - Islamic State fighters possibly seized air-defense weapons when they recaptured the ancient Syrian city of Palmyra, a US general said Wednesday, adding a potential complication to the coalition's air war.L", u'Lieutenant General Stephen Townsend, who commands the US-led coalition bombing IS in Iraq and Syria, said jihadists seized a trove of gear when they retook the desert city from Russia-backed Syrian regime troops on Sunday."', u'"We believe that includes some armored vehicles and various guns and other heavy weapons, possibly some air-defense equipment," Townsend said in a video briefing from Baghdad.T', u'The US-coalition that has been bombing IS since 2014 has enjoyed near-total air superiority across Iraq and Syria, sustaining only limited small-arms damage to a couple of aircraft."', u'"Basically, anything they (IS) seize poses a threat to the coalition, but we can manage those threats and we will," Townsend said."', u'"I anticipate that we\'ll have opportunities to strike that equipment and kill the ISIL that\'s operating it soon."Townsend did not describe whether the air-defense weapons were anti-aircraft guns or missiles.I', u'IS overran Palmyra on Sunday, nine months after being expelled by Russian air strikes and forces loyal to President Bashar Al-Assad.I', u'IS had initially seized Palmyra in May 2015 and went on to blow up UNESCO-listed Roman-era temples and loot ancient relics.T', u'Townsend said the coalition would, at least initially, defer to the Russians to try to retake Palmyra."', u'"If they don\'t, we will do what we need to do to defend ourselves and we\'ll de-conflict those actions with the Russians."The Pentagon and coalition partners have accused Moscow and Damascus of taking their eyes off Palmyra to focus on bombing the former rebel bastion of Aleppo.T', u'The US-led coalition, which is narrowly focused on fighting the IS group, has not had an active role in Aleppo, and Townsend said the regime\'s recapture of the city would have only a "relatively moderate" effect on coalition actions in Syria."', u'"Because I think the regime and the opposition forces that are fighting their war adjacent to ours will take their fight elsewhere," he said without giving details.']

[u'Baghdad (AFP) - Multiple ground assaults and a deluge of air strikes shrank the Islamic State group\'s "caliphate" to a rump and decimated its fighters in 2016 but the organisation remains a potent threat.T', u'The jihadists have squandered close to half of the land they controlled in 2014 and many of their losses came this year, which saw major operations by myriad forces and countries.T', u"The loss of symbolic bastions such as Fallujah in Iraq or Dabiq in Syria dented IS's aura, revealing it could not defend places it once vowed were impregnable and central to its own mythology.T", u"The jihadists were driven out of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's vast western province of Anbar, as well as Manbij in Syria -- strategic areas crucial to the caliphate's territorial continuity.E", u'Earlier this month, they also lost Sirte, their last major bastion in Libya, a country the jihadists had hoped could drive the expansion of the caliphate.I', u'In October, tens of thousands of Iraqi forces backed by air strikes from a US-led coalition launched a massive operation to retake Mosul, the city where IS supremo Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi proclaimed his "state" in June 2014.T', u"The going has been tough for the security forces in the booby-trapped and sniper-infested streets of Iraq's second city but there is little doubt the vastly outnumbered jihadists will eventually lose their stronghold.S", u'Shaping operations for a similar assault on Raqa, the only other major urban centre in IS hands, were subsequently launched in Syria setting up a battle that could be the caliphate\'s last stand."', u'"The loss of Raqa will mean the end of IS\'s state-building project and would leave the group with no territorial symbol justifying its name of Islamic State," said Mathieu Guidere, a Paris-based professor of Middle East geopolitics.W', u'Western powers, Turkey, Iran, Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish forces and militias and paramilitary outfits have played a part in the surge against IS in 2016.- Terror attacks -Despite the formidable arsenal IS seized from regular forces and the fear it instilled in the world with its campaign of well-publicised atrocities, the jihadist group stopped expanding and eventually buckled.A', u'According to the Pentagon, at least 50,000 IS fighters have been killed since 2014, twice the number of fighters the coalition estimated the group had when the caliphate was proclaimed."', u'"Almost three million people and more than 44,000 square kilometres of territory have been liberated" from IS in 2016, coalition commander Lieutenant General Steve Townsend said Wednesday.B', u'But coordination between the various, sometimes rival anti-IS forces is still lacking and the jihadists have shown in two months of Mosul fighting they would not be defeated easily.T', u'Their urban tactics are well-honed and their seemingly endless supply of suicide bombers is a threat even the best-trained and equipped forces on the ground fear like no other.I', u"IS has also launched a number of diversionary attacks in both Iraq and Syria in an effort to stretch their opponents' ranks and retain some level of initiative, at least in the media.T", u"Those came in the shape of a spectacular commando raid on Iraq's oil-rich and Kurdish-controlled city of Kirkuk and earlier this month with the recapture of the Syrian oasis city of Palmyra from regime forces.O", u"Observers have long warned that territorial reconquest would not spell the end of the Islamic State group, which will find in both Iraq's and Syria's instability a fertile ground for future attacks. ", u'"2016 was the year of IS\' decline but its influence is still great because there is no political solution in sight... especially for the Sunni population in both countries," Guidere said. ', u'The remnants of IS could in some ways be harder to fight once they have fully reverted to a clandestine insurgent group focused on terror attacks. ', u"The feared mass return of the caliphate's routed foreign fighters is also a huge source of concern at the end of a year that saw attacks claimed or inspired by IS in the United States, France and Belgium. ", u'"The group has been laying the groundwork to outlast its territorial defeats, framing such losses as temporary setbacks in Iraq and Syria and arguing that the Islamic State is a state of mind as much as it is a governing state," the Soufan Group consultancy said earlier this month.']

[u'Washington (AFP) - Barack Obama on Thursday said the United States would retaliate against Russian hacking after the White House accused Vladimir Putin of direct involvement in cyberattacks designed to influence the US election.T', u'The outgoing US president\'s remarks dramatically upped the stakes in a dispute between the world\'s leading nuclear powers over interference that may have swayed last month\'s tight election in which Republican billionaire Donald Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton."', u'"I think there is no doubt that when any foreign government tries to impact the integrity of our elections that we need to take action," Obama told NPR radio."', u'"And we will, at a time and place of our own choosing."Pointing the finger at the Russian president over meddling in the election also puts the White House on a collision course with Trump, who has become increasingly isolated in questioning Russian involvement in hacks of Democratic Party emails that appeared to have slowed the momentum of Clinton\'s campaign.O', u'Obama is expected to be peppered with questions about the dispute and any subsequent action when he holds a news conference Friday at 2:15 pm (1915 GMT) before leaving for a vacation in Hawaii."', u'"I don\'t think things happen in the Russian government of this consequence without Vladimir Putin knowing about it," one of his top advisers, Ben Rhodes, said earlier Thursday."', u'"Everything we know about how Russia operates and how Putin controls that government would suggest that, again, when you\'re talking about a significant cyber intrusion like this, we\'re talking about the highest levels of government," he told MSNBC television."', u'"And ultimately, Vladimir Putin is the official responsible for the actions of the Russian government."- \'Not a joke\' -White House spokesman Josh Earnest echoed his comments, saying the decision by US intelligence agencies in October to blame "Russia\'s senior-most officials" was not meant to be "particularly subtle."Trump caused outrage in July by suggesting that Russia find 30,000 missing emails related to Clinton\'s use of a private server when she was secretary of state.

', u'I m disturbed that the top diplomat of the United States, fostering American diplomacy, peacekeeping, conflict-resolution, is the head of ExxonMobil.

', u'Several weeks ago, I traveled through Central Europe and witnessed firsthand this Islamic tsunami. ', u'Across Austria and Germany, I saw tens of thousands of people pouring in, with few constraints on their whereabouts and behavior. ', u'It was clear that it was only a matter of time before the chaos turned far more convulsive and violent. ', u'Let s be clear: Some of them may be fleeing war and persecution, but most are not.

', u'Crowley also relayed secondhand anecdotal evidence:  We were told that many Muslims turned away food provided by the International Red Cross because it was stamped with a Christian cross. ', u'We were also told that many of the men carry weapons, knives specifically, which they often use to threaten those trying to help them.

', u'It is an all-encompassing ideological system that dictates everything from law (Shariah) to personal relationships which also have religious elements. ', u'Conquest and subjugation of the infidel lands are integral to this totalitarian ideology, by the sword, if necessary. ', u'It therefore requires that we fight this war the way we fought the Nazis in World War II and Soviet communists during the Cold War: comprehensively and strategically, with every available military, economic, ideological, diplomatic, cyber- and religious lever. ', u'We must stop this threat before it metastasizes further and fully consumes Western Civilization. ', u'In June, following the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Crowley accused President Obama of trying  to change the narrative from the truth  by refusing to label the gunman a radical Islamic terrorist and the shooting  an act of war against the United States. ', u'Islamic supremacism they cannot and will not fight,  she wrote of the administration. ', u'The global jihad is an endless, relentless religiously driven violent movement of conquest. ', u'In August, Crowley told Fox News  Sean Hannity that the parents of Hillary Clinton s top aide, Huma Abedin, are  essentially tools of the Saudi regime  bent on spreading Islam  and Sharia across the West, including in the United States.

[u'By David ShepardsonWASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. ', u'Federal Communications Commission Chairman Tom Wheeler plans to step down on Jan. 20, he said on Thursday, a move expected to hand Republicans a 2-1 majority on the panel when Donald Trump takes office as president.W', u'Wheeler could have kept the commission at 2-2 until Trump names a new member who needs to be confirmed by the Senate.

O\'Rielly criticized the FCC\'s decision in October to impose stricter privacy rules on internet service providers than on websites like Facebook Inc or Twitter Inc. Last month Wheeler dropped plans to push through a proposed reform of the $45 billion business data services market.

[u'DENVER (AP)   A rural Colorado school district decided to allow its teachers and other school staff to carry guns on campus to protect students.T', u'The Hanover School District 28 board voted 3-2 Wednesday night to allow school employees to volunteer to be armed on the job after undergoing training.T', u"The district's two schools serve about 270 students about 30 miles southeast of Colorado Springs, and it takes law enforcement an average of 20 minutes to get there.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   There's more hustle than hope behind an effort to derail Donald Trump's presidency in the Electoral College.R", u'Republican electors are being swamped with pleas to buck tradition and cast ballots for someone else at meetings across the country Monday that are on course to ratify Trump as the winner. ', u'AP interviews with more than 330 electors from both parties found little appetite for a revolt.W', u"Whether they like Trump or not, and some plainly don't, scores of the Republicans chosen to cast votes in the state-capital meetings told AP they feel bound by history, duty, party loyalty or the law to rubber-stamp their state's results and make him president. ", u'Appeals numbering in the tens of thousands   drowning inboxes, ringing cellphones, stuffing home and office mailboxes with actual handwritten letters   have not swayed them.T', u'The interviews found widespread Democratic aggravation with the electoral process but little expectation that the rush of anti-Trump maneuvering can stop him. ', u'For that to happen, Republican-appointed electors would have to stage an unprecedented defection.S', u'Still, people going to the typically ho-hum electoral gatherings have been drawn into the rough and tumble of campaign-season politics. ', u'Republicans are being beseeched to revolt in a torrent of lobbying, centered on the arguments that Clinton won the popular vote and that Trump is unsuited to the presidency. ', u'Most of it is falling on deaf ears, but it has also led to some acquaintances being made across the great political divide."', u'"Let me give you the total as of right now: 48,324 emails about my role as an elector," said Brian Westrate, a small-business owner and GOP district chairman in Fall Creek, Wisconsin. ', u'"I have a Twitter debate with a former porn star from California asking me to change my vote. It\'s been fascinating."Similarly deluged, Republican elector Hector Maldonado, a Missouri National Guardsman, has taken the time to console one correspondent, a single mother and Air Force veteran who is beside herself with worry about what a Trump presidency will mean."', u'"Everything\'s going to be OK," he said he told her. ', u'"I know you\'re scared, but don\'t worry. Everything\'s going to be OK. And I know that it will be."Maldonado, a Mexican immigrant and medical-equipment seller in Sullivan, Missouri, backed Ted Cruz in the primaries but will cast his vote for Trump with conviction. ', u'"I took an oath once to become a U.S. citizen," he said, "and on Aug. 14, 1995, that was the first oath that I\'ve taken to support the U.S. Constitution. A year later I took the oath again, to support the duties of being an officer in the U.S. Army. This was the third oath that I\'ve taken to execute what I promised to do."Even a leader of the anti-Trump effort, Bret Chiafalo of Everett, Washington, calls it a "losing bet"   but one he says the republic\'s founders would want him to make. ', u'"I believe that Donald Trump is a unique danger to our country and the Founding Fathers put the Electoral College in place to, among other things, stop that from happening," said Chiafalo, 38, an Xbox network engineer who backed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries.I', u'It takes 270 electoral votes to make a president. ', u'Despite losing the national popular vote, Trump won enough states to total 306 electoral votes. ', u'He would need to see three dozen fall away for him to lose his majority. ', u"Only one Republican elector told AP he won't vote for Trump.O", u"Over the sweep of history, so-called faithless electors   those who vote for someone other than their state's popular-vote winner   have been exceptionally rare.N", u'Nashville attorney Tom Lawless, who chose Marco Rubio in the primaries, described his vow to cast his electoral vote for Trump in blunt terms. ', u'"Hell will freeze and we will be skating on the lava before I change," he said. ', u'"He won the state and I\'ve pledged and gave my word that that\'s what I would do. And I won\'t break it."Nor will Jim Skaggs, 78, a developer from Bowling Green, Kentucky, despite deep concern about Trump. ', u'"His personality worries me," Skaggs said. ', u'"He is not open-minded." Skaggs knew Trump\'s father through the construction business, met the son in his 20s, and "I wasn\'t impressed.""I hope he is far better than I think he is," Skaggs said. ', u'Even so, "I fully intend to vote for Donald Trump," he said. ', u'"I think it\'s a duty."State law and practices vary for electors, but even in states where electors don\'t take an oath to vote a certain way or don\'t face legal ramifications for stepping out of line, the heavy expectation is for them to ratify the results. ', u'As much as they don\'t want Trump in office, some Democrats are as reluctant as Republicans to go rogue."', u'"We lost the election," said John Padilla of Albuquerque, New Mexico, a Democratic ward chairman. ', u'"That\'s how elections are and you shake hands with your opponent and you get on with what you have to do and support your candidate."Yet Democratic electors, stung by losing an election to a Republican who trails Clinton by more than 2.6 million votes nationwide, spoke strongly in the interviews in favor of overhauling or throwing out the electoral system. ', u'Republican electors generally supported it, reasoning that it provides a counterweight to political dominance by coastal states with huge, and largely Democratic, populations, like California and New York.C', u'Chiafalo is a co-founder of the Hamilton Electors, a group formed to steer other electors from both parties to a third candidate. ', u'"We\'ve stated from Day 1 this is a long shot, this is a Hail Mary," he said. ', u"But if the effort fails, it won't be from lack of trying. ", u'Most of the pleas to reject Trump are coordinated, automated, professionally generated and, for those reasons, none too persuasive. ', u'"We got a stack of letters from idiots," said Republican elector Edward Robson, 86, a Phoenix, Arizona, homebuilder. ', u'Fellow elector Carole Joyce, 72, a state committeewoman in Phoenix and retired public health nurse, was more charitable. ', u'"They\'ve caused me great distress on my computer, that\'s for sure," she said. ', u'"I average anywhere from a thousand to 3,000 emails a day. And I\'m getting inundated in my regular mailbox out front   anywhere from 17 to 35 letters a day coming from Washington state, Oregon, all around the country. Hand-written, some of them five or six pages long, quoting me the Federalist Papers, the Constitution, asking me again out of desperation not to vote for Donald Trump.

[u'The 2013 hack affecting a billion Yahoo users shows how seemingly innocuous bits of data gleaned from cyber attacks can be exploited for espionage and information warfare, as well as for profit.T', u'The breach, disclosed Wednesday, is the largest on record and comes just months after Yahoo disclosed a separate attack in 2014 affecting data from 500 million users.O', u'On the surface, the trove of data is "a bunch of junk," said John Dickson of the security consultancy Denim Group.B', u'But the ability to create a searchable database with data tidbits such as birth dates and phone numbers makes it enormously valuable to hackers seeking to make a profit or engage in industrial or state espionage, he said."', u'"If you\'re trying to research and get information about a target, you\'re going to use everything you can find," said Dickson, a former officer in the Air Force Information Warfare Center.T', u'The Yahoo hack did not collect credit card or Social Security numbers, according to the company, leading some analysts to speculate that the goals were not financial."', u'"For someone using data as a weapon, this is of tremendous value," said Steve Grobman, chief technical officer at Intel Security.- Information warfare? -James Scott, a senior fellow at the Institute for Critical Infrastructure Technology, a cybersecurity think tank, said that while details are still unknown, the attack could fuel disinformation campaigns by governments.S', u'Scott noted that the data had not appeared for sale on Deep Web markets -- that is, in murky corners of the web that cannot be reached by standard search engines."', u'"And since a significant number of victims (if any) have not reported identity theft resulting from the incident, there is a strong likelihood that the breach was not conducted for monetary gain," Scott said."', u'"This could indicate that the breach was an espionage stage of an information warfare effort."The disclosure of the breach comes amid intense scrutiny of cybersecurity in the US election campaign and of the potential impact of hacked email accounts from people close to Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.U', u'US officials have claimed Russia was behind the attack aimed at disrupting the election.O', u'One of the hacks was a Gmail account of Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. ', u'Media reports say he or an assistant was fooled by a fake email that prompted him to reveal his password.S', u'Security analysts say such attacks are often preceded by lengthy data-gathering campaigns that might look for personal information such as a birth date or former school or university.- Signs of a state actor -Yahoo said it was not clear who was behind the billion-user hack but that some evidence pointed to "the same state-sponsored actor" believed responsible for the previously disclosed cyber attack.T', u'The security firm InfoArmor said in September that its analysis of the first breach indicated "professional" hackers stole the Yahoo data, and only later sold it to a state entity. ', u'InfoArmor said at the time that the breach "opens the door to significant opportunities for cyber espionage and targeted attacks to occur." G', u'Grobman said some attackers may mix real data with manipulated information to distort facts, creating further confusion and mistrust. ', u'"One of the things we are concerned about is that the public is conditioned to see leaked data as legitimate, and this data can be manipulated," Grobman said. ', u"Some analysts argue that the hackers' goals may be more financial than political. ", u'Security researcher Graham Cluley said certain bits of information such as phone numbers could be of value to criminals. ', u'"If a hacker or scammer has your telephone number, they can ring you up and trick you into believing they are an organization you already have a relationship with, which means that you might be tempted to hand over more personal information," Cluley said in a YouTube posting. - \'A lot of money\' - J', u'James Lewis, a senior fellow specializing in cybersecurity at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said new analytics tools can sift through databases for political espionage purposes, but that it is not clear if Russia has those capabilities. ', u'"If you\'re a criminal, you would think you could monetize a billion accounts," Lewis said. ', u'"Even if you got a penny or a dime for each, you would still be making a lot of money." T', u'The attacks also pose a threat to the future of Yahoo, the former internet star which has seen its fortunes decline and is in the process of selling its main assets to telecom group Verizon. ', u'Dickson said that it\'s likely that "Verizon is doing a double take" on the $4.8 billion deal.

', u'In some other states, a shortage of lethal injection drugs has reduced executions.B', u'Besides the seven executions carried out in Texas, 12 other inmates were scheduled to die in 2016 but at least temporarily avoided the death chamber.

He also said he is ready to talk to countries in the region and the United States to work toward the resolution," Nogami said.A', u'Abe and Putin are seeking progress in a two-day summit on their dispute over the four windswept isles in the western Pacific controlled by Russia but also claimed by Japan.

[u'United States  Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on Wednesday set new cannabis extract laws by amending the Schedule I Controlled Substances Act to include tighter regulations for marijuana extracts, including cannabidiol (CBD).I', u'In the new drug code titled  Establishment of a New Drug Code for Marihuana Extract,  the DEA says it is  creating a separate code number for marihuana extract with the following definition:  Meaning an extract containing one or more cannabinoids that has been derived from any plant of the genus Cannabis, other than the separated resin (whether crude or purified) obtained from the plant. ', u'Extracts of marihuana will continue to be treated as Schedule I controlled substances.

[u'A 12-year-old boy from the German town of Rhineland-Palatinate is suspected of trying to detonate a homemade combustible on two separate occasions at the behest of an Islamic State member, as investigators told German media.G', u'German police say the boy first tried to set off the device   a primitive nail bomb made using powder from fireworks and sparklers, which proved flammable but not explosive   in late November near a Christmas market in Ludwigshafen, before trying and failing again on Dec. 5 near a city hall, according to the Local.

[u'A new Rohingya insurgency in Myanmar\'s Rakhine is a "game-changer" for the troubled state, conflict experts said Thursday, warning the army\'s crackdown risks setting off a spiral of violence and radicalisation among the Muslim minority.T', u'Troops have taken control of the north of the state since October 9 when armed men carried out raids on posts along the Bangladesh border, killing nine police in a series of coordinated attacks.A', u"At least 27,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since with stories of mass-killings, rape and torture at the hands of security forces which have heaped pressure on Aung San Suu Kyi's administration.M", u'Myanmar\'s government has roundly rejected the accusations of abuse, saying the military is hunting down hundreds of "terrorists" behind the raids and the weapons they stole.T', u'The International Crisis Group (ICG) said the attackers were a Saudi-backed group called Harakah al-Yaqin, which has spent years recruiting and training fighters in Bangladesh and northern Rakhine.E', u'Emerging after deadly sectarian violence in 2012, the ICG said the insurgency aimed to advance the political rights of the persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority.B', u'But it warned the heavy-handed response by Myanmar\'s army risked pushing its followers into the hands of international jihadists."', u'"The emergence of this well-organised, apparently well-funded group is a game-changer in the Myanmar government\'s efforts to address the complex challenges in Rakhine State," the report said."', u'"The current security response is likely to drive a dangerous spiral of attacks, military responses and increased popular radicalisation."Dozens of Rohingya have died at the hands of security forces in the past two months and many others have drowned trying to cross the river into Bangladesh, whose border guards have turned back over 60 boatloads of people this month.T', u"The ICG said Harakah al-Yaqin's front man was Ata Ullah, an ethnic Rohingya featured in several videos posted online who was born in the Pakistani city of Karachi and grew up in Saudi Arabia.B", u'Backed by 20 Rohingya with international fighting experience, and a Saudi-trained mufti, it said he has spent at least two years training hundreds of recruits in guerrilla warfare and explosives.T', u'The Saudi embassy in Yangon had no immediate comment on the report.W', u"While the Rohingya's plight has long been a rallying cry for international jihadists, including the Taliban and so-called Islamic State, there has been little evidence of a significant domestic insurgency before now.D", u'Days after the border post attacks, Myanmar accused a Pakistani Taliban-trained militant named Hafiz Tohar of leading the raids.

[u"SAN FRANCISCO   Though volcanoes dot the face of the planet and can be found on every continent, researchers say most of Earth's volcanic eruptions happen in a dark and faraway place: deep underwater. ", u"And now, last year's eruption of one of the most active submarine volcanoes is offering clues about these explosive processes, which could help scientists better understand volcanoes on land, including those that pose serious threats to humans.I", u'In April 2015, an underwater volcano known as Axial Seamount erupted 290 miles (470 kilometers) off the coast of Oregon. ', u'Thanks to a network of underwater sensors, scientists were able to study the submarine volcano more closely than ever before. ', u'The researchers presented some of the first scientific results from that eruption in a news briefing here today (Dec. 15) at the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union.A', u"Axial Seamount's previous eruptions, in 1998 and 2011, prompted scientists to deploy a network of seven seismic stations to study the volcano. ", u'This depth map shows the raised outer edge (dark red) of the Axial Seamount s central caldera. ', u'Lava from the new 2015 eruption, at the northeast corner of the caldera and to the north, is outlined in green. ', u'Lava from the 2011 eruption is outlined in blue. ', u'John Delaney/Center for Environmental Visualization/University of Washington"As the volcano is recharged with magma, the surface of the volcano swells like a balloon," Nooner said. ', u'"Then during an eruption, the magma is taken out of the underlying magma chamber and the surface of the volcano drops."The scientists also observed increased seismicity leading up to the April eruption. ', u'Before the volcanic event, the frequency of minor earthquakes near the volcano increased from fewer than 500 per day to about 2,000 per day, they said.B', u"Beyond the seismic sensors and seafloor mapping, there is an entire network of other instruments that make up the volcano's underwater observatory. ", u"From cameras and temperature measurements, to instruments that collect data about the chemistry and biology of the volcanic area, this network will make Axial Seamount one of the world's most well-studied volcanoes, the researchers said.T", u'Though far from posing a threat to human lives, the underwater eruption of Axial Seamount is very turbulent."', u'"Underwater volcanoes make a mess," said research partner David Clague, a geologist and volcanologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in Moss Landing, California. ', u'"The water column is full of small particles that are emitted during the eruption, bits of glass and bacteria from the subsurface."Even months after an eruption event, researchers can still have difficulty studying the volcano because of the cloudy water, they said.O', u'One of the next phases of the research will investigate how local ecosystems are affected by such an explosive eruption."', u'"When this volcano erupts the next time, we will have an even larger data set than we have now," said study co-author William Wilcock, a geologist at the University of Washington.

[u'The current industry campaign draws on the same 50-state strategy that painkiller manufacturers successfully deployed to help kill or weaken measures aimed at stemming the tide of prescription opioids, a playbook The Associated Press and Center for Public Integrity exposed in September.T', u'The reporting detailed how opioid drugmakers and the nonprofits they help fund spent more than $880 million on lobbying and political contributions at the state and federal level over the past decade, eight times what the gun lobby reported for the same period. ', u'The money represents the drugmakers  spending on all their legislative interests, including opioids.T', u'The FDA has approved a handful of the reformulated drugs but has not yet concluded that any reduce rates of addiction, abuse or death, and the evidence gap has led to diverging views among health authorities.W', u'Whereas FDA regulators emphasize the potential promise of reformulated painkillers, other government officials stress that they contain the same heroin-like ingredients as traditional opioids. ', u'An estimated 78 Americans die from heroin and prescription opioid overdoses every day. ', u'Abuse-deterrent  sounds to people sometimes like  Oh, maybe it s not addictive. ', u'But it s no less addictive,  said Dr. Tom Frieden, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.S', u'Survey results published this year in the Clinical Journal of Pain showed nearly half of U.S. physicians incorrectly believed that reformulated opioids are less addictive than their predecessors.M', u'Many experts see a key role for ADFs in reducing the number of people who first begin abusing opioids, and some say the abuse-deterrent formulations should be the default painkiller for patients with histories of drug use, anxiety or depression. ', u'But even they worry that some drugmakers are overselling the technology. ', u'They stress that separate measures are needed for the majority of opioid abusers who ingest the pills orally. ', u'The way they re handling the ADF is that this is the answer. ', u'And it s not the answer   it s part of the bigger puzzle,  said Theodore Cicero, a psychiatry professor at Washington University in St. ', u'Louis, who has authored several studies on the drugs. ', u'You can t put a price tag on anybody s life Two years after the overdose that killed her 21-year-old son, Terri Bartlett traveled to Illinois  state capital to champion an unlikely cause: revamped painkillers.B', u'Bartlett s son Michael became hooked on Vicodin and later graduated to heroin. ', u'In emotional testimony last year, she urged lawmakers to support a bill that would prioritize the new harder-to-crush pills, saying she believed her son would still be alive if abuse-deterrent formulations had been on the market then. ', u'You can t put a price tag on anybody s life,  she said.B', u'Bartlett didn t know then that she had been recruited into a wide-ranging lobbying campaign. ', u'A public relations firm hired by OxyContin-maker Purdue had helped recruit her to support the bill, along with local sheriffs and fire chiefs.H', u'Her words, and similar testimony from parents of drug abusers elsewhere, reflect a tactic used by the drugmakers across the country. ', u'For instance, Purdue paid nearly $95,000 for similar lobbying efforts in New York, state records show.A', u'And the industry s fingerprints are easy to spot in other areas. ', u'Of more than 100 bills dealing with the drugs introduced in 35 states in 2015 and 2016, at least 49 featured nearly identical language requiring insurers to cover abuse-deterrent drugs, according to an analysis of data from Quorum, a legislative tracking service. ', u'Several of the bill sponsors said they received the wording from pharmaceutical lobbyists.S', u'Since 2012, at least 21 bills related to the drugs have become law, including five that require insurers to pay for the more expensive drugs in Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Florida and West Virginia.W', u'Wins in such states will give drugmakers momentum to successfully push for copycat laws elsewhere, noted Paul Kelly, a federal lobbyist who has worked on multistate lobbying campaigns for drugstores and major retailers. ', u'It s like a foot in the door,  he said.D', u'Drugmakers have found fierce opposition to their ADF legislation from insurers and employers who would be on the hook for the far pricier opioid variations. ', u'The Illinois bill   and the 48 strikingly similar measures in other states   would require insurers to cover the drugs in the same way as other opioids, which the insurance companies argue would allow drugmakers to charge whatever they want for them. ', u'That is not the best use of our medical care resources,  Vernon Rowen, vice president of state government affairs for the insurance company Aetna, told Illinois lawmakers after Bartlett testified. ', u'It totally eliminates our ability to negotiate discounts with manufacturers. ', u'New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie both vetoed such insurance mandates in the past year, citing the high costs and lack of evidence that the drugs help. ', u'Federal health officials also have pushed back against requirements to cover the drugs, citing the  staggering  costs. ', u'For example, a 30-day supply of Pfizer s abuse-deterrent Embeda, a combination drug containing morphine, costs $268, while a 30-day supply of a generic morphine costs roughly $38, according to data compiled by Truven Health Analytics, a company that tracks drug prices set by manufacturers. ', u'The Department of Veterans Affairs  Dr. Bernie Good estimated that converting the 8.8 million patient system exclusively to the new reformulations would increase opioid spending more than tenfold, to over $1.6 billion annually. ', u'Good, who co-directs the VA s program for medication safety, said the vast majority of veterans are not at risk for snorting or injecting their medications. ', u'Would the excess money to pay for abuse-deterrent products   mostly to pay for it in cases where it wouldn t be necessary   be better spent for drug treatment centers?  he asked at a recent federal meeting on the drugs. ', u'Federal estimates say at least 2.2 million Americans are addicted to prescription opioids or heroin, yet only one in five actually receives treatment, according to a Surgeon General s report published last month. ', u'That s despite some $35 billion already spent annually on substance abuse programs by private and public health providers. ', u'State lawmakers who support the abuse-deterrent bills often defend them as an important piece of solving the opioid puzzle, preventing more costly overdoses and hospitalizations. ', u'And Fred Brason, executive director of Project Lazarus, a North Carolina-based group that promotes anti-addiction policies in several states, called the focus on the drugs  cost too narrow. ', u'You re already spending that money at the back end,  he said. ', u'You re spending it at the emergency department. ', u'He also noted the costs of addiction treatment. ', u'When critics raise alarms about higher costs and limited evidence, drugmakers can rely on groups they support financially to argue their side, including the National Association of Drug Diversion Investigators, the Academy of Integrative Pain Management and the Partnership for Drug-Free Kids. ', u'Representatives from those groups have testified in favor of abuse-deterrent legislation in at least seven states. ', u'NADDI president Charlie Cichon acknowledged his group receives funds from several ADF-makers, but said it views the drugs as a proven part of the solution to the opioid crisis. ', u'We re not testifying for Purdue Pharma s product or Endo s product,  he said. ', u'And Bob Twillman, executive director of the Academy, said,  Increased use of abuse-deterrent opioids makes it more likely that those patients who need opiates to treat their pain will be able to get them. ', u'The Partnership for Drug-Free Kids did not respond to multiple requests for comment. ', u'Physicians with financial ties to drugmakers play similar roles. ', u'Gareth Shemesh, a pain specialist, testified in support of a Colorado bill last year brought to the sponsoring legislator by Pfizer. ', u'Shemesh had received more than $13,500 from Pfizer that year in speaking fees, travel and meals, and more than $5,000 from Purdue the year before. ', u'He did not respond to calls for comment, but Pfizer said he was not paid to testify and did not speak on behalf of any specific product. ', u'Purdue and Pfizer also have ramped up contributions to the Republican and Democratic attorneys general associations, which raise unlimited funds to help elect AGs across the country. ', u'In 2015 and 2016, they gave a total of $950,000   more than in the previous four years combined. ', u'To date, 51 attorneys general from U.S. states and territories have signed at least one of two National Association of Attorneys General letters to the FDA, urging the agency to favor abuse-deterrent drugs. ', u'The pro-ADF playbook even includes a bit of political theater. ', u'In at least seven states, lawmakers or advocates have pounded the reformulated pills with hammers to demonstrate how difficult they are to smash. ', u'In Illinois, it was Democratic Rep. ', u'Sara Feigenholtz wielding the hammer on the same committee that heard Terri Bartlett s testimony. ', u'The main sponsor of the bill prioritizing ADFs, Feigenholtz ranked second-highest among legislative recipients of money from Pfizer since the start of 2010, according to an analysis of data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics. ', u'The $6,200 she received during that period was more than she had received in the 14 previous years combined. ', u'Her bill passed the committee but later stalled in the Legislature and remains pending. ', u'She did not return multiple requests for comment. ', u'Pfizer said its contributions to Feigenholtz go back 20 years and it would be  inaccurate and misleading  to suggest a tie to any one piece of legislation. ', u'Bartlett said she doesn t mind that Purdue was ultimately responsible for her invitation to testify, even though she didn t know that at the time. ', u'She still supports the bill. ', u'I want to believe that in every pharmaceutical company there still remains some sort of humanity,  she said. ', u'Saving life is expensive. ', u"Don't miss another Politics investigation: Sign up for the Center for Public Integrity's Watchdog email. ", u'An addict can find a way      T', u'The FDA has walked a careful line on the new drugs, promoting them as a promising approach to discouraging abuse while acknowledging their real-world benefits remain largely theoretical. ', u'Earlier this year, the agency highlighted the drugs in its  opioids action plan,  issued after scathing criticism from some members of Congress that the FDA wasn t doing enough to combat the epidemic. ', u'Thus far, the agency has approved seven drugs with labeling suggesting they are  expected to  discourage abuse, based on studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies. ', u'But the FDA has not yet concluded that any of the products have a  real-world impact  on measures like overdose or death, according to Dr. Douglas Throckmorton, an agency deputy director. ', u'He and other regulators predict, however, that the reformulations will eventually translate into public health results. ', u'We stand by those predictions,  Throckmorton said at a recent public meeting on the drugs. ', u'We re confident in the science, we re confident in the assessments we conducted. ', u'Even some former FDA advisers who support expanded use of the drugs say they are only part of the solution. ', u'Lewis Nelson, who previously chaired an FDA panel on drug safety, notes that the drugs don t deter the most common form of abuse: swallowing pills whole. ', u'Certainly, you might not eat one and get high,  he said. ', u'You eat three and get high. ', u'At least one study found that while OxyContin s reformulation coincided with many abusers switching to other drugs, other users still were able to defeat the pills  technology and snort or inject the contents. ', u'David Rook, a 40-year-old Henrico, Virginia, resident who now operates a recovery facility, was among them. ', u'Before entering treatment, he said, he would break down abuse-deterrent OxyContins and crush-resistant Opanas using water, lemon juice and a microwave. ', u'The truth is an addict can find a way to abuse a medication one way or the other,  he said. ', u'A recent HIV outbreak in rural Indiana illustrates the sometimes unpredictable effect of ADFs on abusers  behavior. ', u'Approximately 210 people have tested positive for the virus in Scott County since 2014, a public health crisis linked to needle-sharing among abusers of Opana. ', u'Endo Pharmaceuticals received approval for a reformulated version of the drug in 2011, making it harder to crush. ', u'As a result, many abusers switched from snorting the drug to injecting it with syringes, leading to the spread of the blood-borne HIV virus, according to the state health commissioner and other officials. ', u'Endo spokeswoman Heather Zoumas Lubeski declined to comment on the outbreak, but issued a statement saying,  Patient safety has always been a top priority for Endo and we are committed to providing patients with approved products that are safe and effective when used as prescribed. ', u'The FDA declined to approve labeling claims for Opana s anti-abuse features, noting that the drug still can easily be cooked and injected. ', u'Pfizer, Purdue, Endo and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries Ltd. spent more than $20 million between 2012 and 2015 on federal lobbying efforts that included support of a bill that would require the FDA to gradually replace current opioids with harder-to-abuse versions that become available. ', u'Teva declined comment. ', u'William Keating, D-Mass., first introduced the bill in 2012 and tried again in 2013 and 2015. ', u'Like his colleagues at the state level, he employed the hammer-smashing routine to illustrate the medications  crush-resistant properties. ', u"Don't miss another Politics investigation: Sign up for the Center for Public Integrity's Watchdog email. ", u'Keating said the industry played no part in spurring the bill, even though the head of a nonprofit association funded by abuse-deterrent drugmakers spoke at the press conference introducing his legislation. ', u'He also received $2,500 in political contributions from makers of reformulated opioids in 2011 and 2012, a small fraction of his overall fundraising haul. ', u'My interest in this stems from when I was a district attorney and I got to see the lives that were lost,  Keating said in an interview. ', u'While Keating s bill has not received a vote in Congress, the FDA already has begun moving in the direction suggested by companies, mapping out a process for removing older opioids from the market when newer versions are shown to be more effective at thwarting abuse. ', u'You don t have to pass a bill, necessarily, to change policy,  said Dan Cohen of the Abuse Deterrent Coalition, which represents smaller abuse-deterrent manufacturers. ', u'The lack of real-world data on reformulated opioids is the main reason some federal officials haven t embraced them. ', u'The CDC did not recommend ADFs in its landmark opioid guidelines this year, the first-ever federal recommendations for doctors prescribing the drugs. ', u'Frieden, the agency s director, said his staff could not find any evidence showing the updated opioids actually reduce rates of addiction, overdoses or deaths.

[u'Hit-Making PowerThe most dramatic departure from the CR-V s hit-making formula can be found under the hood. ', u'A turbocharged 1.5-liter engine comes as standard issue in EX, EX-L, and Touring trims, while the base LX carries over the previous model s naturally aspirated 2.4-liter four-cylinder. ', u'Similar to the turbo 1.5-liter found in the current Civic, the CR-V s has a slightly lower compression ratio (10.3:1 in the CR-V versus 10.6:1 in the Civic) and higher boost pressure to generate 190 horsepower and 179 lb-ft of torque. ', u'That s 5 horses more, but 2 lb-ft less torque, than the former 2.4-liter made yet a significant 16 horsepower and 17 lb-ft more than this engine produces in the Civic.H', u'Honda also updated its all-wheel-drive technology, replacing the previous fixed-ratio 60/40 front/rear torque split with a variable system capable of distributing torque fore or aft based on acceleration, wheelspin, throttle position, and steering-wheel angle. ', u'We found it seamless and virtually transparent in operation, detecting a shift in torque only during abrupt throttle inputs while cornering.A', u'Although CVTs aren t our favorite transmission type, the continuously variable automatic in use here is among the most tolerable. ', u'By simulating  shifts  at the appropriate time, the rubber-band sensation is mostly absent. ', u'After a brief low-rpm lull as the turbo spins up, acceleration is linear and seamless, and the CVT and turbocharged four-cylinder are about as well matched as any automatic-transmission-and-engine combo these days. ', u'Considering that the engine s maximum torque arrives at a relatively low 2000 rpm and hangs on until 5000 rpm, the CVT has a wide swath of grunt to work with, and what it gives up in instant response it makes up for with predictability and by largely staying invisible in operation.A', u'At full throttle, the CR-V hit 60 mph in 7.6 seconds and erased the quarter-mile in 16 seconds flat, clearing the traps at 80 mph. ', u'While far from earth-shaking, these figures shave six-tenths off the times we achieved with the aforementioned 2015 Touring model with the 2.4-liter and CVT. ', u'Those times also are comparable to those of the 2015 Mazda CX-5 2.5L (7.7 and 16.0 seconds) and the 2016 Hyundai Tucson Eco 1.6T AWD (7.4 and 15.9 seconds). ', u'At the quicker end of the segment are the 2017 Ford Escape EcoBoost 2.0-liter (7.1 and 15.6 seconds) and the 2017 Kia Sportage SX Turbo (6.9 and 15.4 seconds).W', u'When it comes to efficiency, though, the CR-V shames all compact-SUV comers. ', u'EPA-rated at 27 mpg in the city and 33 mpg on the highway, the AWD CR-V tops its peers by margins not usually seen within highly competitive segments. ', u'That s a whopping 5 mpg better than both the equivalent all-wheel-drive Escape, which also is powered by a 1.5-liter turbo, and the all-wheel-drive Toyota RAV4. ', u'In our real-world highway fuel-economy test, run at 75 mph, we recorded 32 mpg for the CR-V, just 1 mpg shy of its EPA highway rating.G', u'Giving It a SpinA new, variable-ratio electrically assisted power-steering setup is geared for quicker response than in the previous-generation CR-V. ', u'While the ratio change eases maneuvering in tight spots, we re also happy to report that directional response and turn-in feel is a bit sharper. ', u'It s not exactly sporty, but combined with its good straight-line stability and a smooth ride, the new CR-V certainly makes for pleasant travel for those focused more on the destination than on the next apex. ', u'We measured 0.82 g of grip on the skidpad, where our driver reported mild understeer. ', u'That won t impress many in a world where some cars now routinely approach or surpass the magic 1.00 g figure, but it s a lot more grip than the 0.75 g mustered by the last Toyota RAV4 AWD we tested, and it even tops the 0.81 g of the 2016 Mazda CX-5, long lauded as the spunkiest handler in the compact-crossover pack.A', u'Although our first drive of the 2017 CR-V in Northern California concluded without raising a single brow of interest from fellow motorists, our experience in the Heartland was different. ', u'During our first quick sortie behind the wheel, we were approached by a particularly well-informed CR-V devotee who enthusiastically asked,  Where did you get that car? ', u'I ve been checking all of the dealer inventories in a 150-mile radius! ', u'After answering the usual questions  How do you like the turbo?

[u'New York (AFP) - Hillary Clinton blames Russian President Vladimir Putin, who had a "personal beef" against her, and a late-hour FBI intervention over her email scandal for her loss to Donald Trump in the US election, a newspaper reported Friday.C', u'Clinton, 69, has kept a low profile in the weeks since her shock defeat to the Republican billionaire, but made the remarks to campaign donors in Manhattan on Thursday night, The New York Times reported.T', u'The Democratic former secretary of state won the popular vote by more than 2.7 million ballots but lost the crucial Electoral College by 232 to 306.T', u'Trump walked away with the election because he won a string of swing states. ', u'Crucially his wins in three of those states, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan, amounted to a combined total of around 100,000 votes.T', u'The Times said Clinton told donors that a letter from FBI director James Comey revisiting her private server scandal dating back to her time as secretary of state, 10 days before the election, cost her close races in several states."', u'"Swing-state voters made their decisions in the final days breaking against me because of the FBI letter from Director Comey," the Times quoted her as saying.S', u'She said the hacking of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and her campaign chairman John Podesta\'s emails stemmed from Putin\'s "personal beef" against her, the newspaper reported.C', u'Clinton said the reason was her accusation that Russia\'s 2011 parliamentary elections were rigged."', u'"Putin publicly blamed me for the outpouring of outrage by his own people, and that is the direct line between what he said back then and what he did in this election," the Times quoted her as saying.O', u'On Thursday, Podesta lashed out at the FBI in a scathing op-ed published in The Washington Post, slamming the Federal Bureau of Investigation for its "failure" to adequately respond to the Democratic Party email hacks.A', u'An investigation published by the Times earlier this week said that when the FBI discovered the hack in September 2015, it left phone messages with the DNC "help desk" but did not warn senior Democratic officials or visit in person."', u'"Comparing the FBI\'s massive response to the overblown email scandal with the seemingly lackadaisical response to the very real Russian plot to subvert a national election shows that something is deeply broken at the FBI," he wrote.I', u"In the immediate aftermath of the election, however, some Democrats including advisers close to her husband, former president Bill Clinton, directed blame at Clinton's own campaign.T", u'The campaign reportedly ignored calls from Bill Clinton to spend more time focusing on disaffected white, working class voters -- a key demographic that elected Bill Clinton twice and backed Trump.C', u'Clinton did not visit Wisconsin as the Democratic nominee and only pushed late into Michigan after polls showed the race tightening.']

', u'This will be good for the arts, even if it doesn t feel that way.T', u'There is plenty of evidence that fear is good. ', u'It stimulates, motivates, and gives focus.

', u'Today s source of our despair is tomorrow s creative fodder.T', u'This relationship seems contradictory   aren t bad times for society bad times for artists? ', u'No, they aren t. Art is born from overcoming obstacles, and the harder the times, the more Americans have depended on artists.

', u'The Reagan  80s birthed the AIDS activism that today looks like a prophetic start on social justice and marriage equality. ', u'I first noticed the phenomenon in Chile, where the long dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet had turned folk singers and poets into national tribunes.

', u'But when Pinochet fell, democracy eventually brought with it the collapse of poetry magazines, the return of the mundane.T', u'Then, just one day after the Sept. 11 attacks, I noticed doggerel scrawled by a finger on a dusty window near Ground Zero. ', u'Someone needed to write it. ', u'By the end of that horrible week in 2001, poems by E.E. ', u'Cummings were taped to light posts around Greenwich Village. ', u'Acclaimed poets like Breyten Breytenbach and Seamus Heaney responded to those events with their pens, but so did millions of amateurs worldwide.S', u'Sept. 11 is a sobering example   poetry, the deepest of emotional wells, was precious in that moment of national grief. ', u'But  everything has changed  turned out to be an empty promise. ', u'Irony never did die.

', u'The Trump real estate fantasy of gold-plated luxury has always reflected the stupefying values of commercialism, an invitation not to ask any nagging little questions.B', u'But as a minority-vote president, Trump can be asked a million nagging little questions. ', u'What is legitimate opposition? ', u'Where is the line for free speech? ', u'How is equality defined, and made real? ', u'Who is American? ', u'These questions are inspiring, not threatening, and will endure even if President Trump doesn t serve out his full term   he is, after all, the oldest president to ever assume the office, is shadowed by ties to Russia, and could always pull a Palin, quitting in a blamestorm of frustration.

', u'The president-elect s tweetwar with members of the cast of  Hamilton  shows the phenomenon in action. ', u'Trump tried to silence and intimidate people who see themselves as fair-minded champions of equality. ', u'His demand for deference and conformity only provoked the artists.A', u'Authoritarian presidents can do real harm, as in Turkey, where President Recep Erdogan has arrested hundreds of writers in a harsh crackdown on his liberal and secular opponents. ', u'But Erdogan, a conservative Islamist who declared in 2011 that  Sometimes a book is more dangerous than a bomb,  has only provoked a literary renaissance. ', u'Book sales in the country are increasing dramatically, publisher Cem Erciyes told the New York Times, because people read more in troubled times. ', u'And thinkers of all kinds have been pushed to  take shelter in the world of books. ', u'The book is the oldest media   its wisdom, its accumulation of knowledge, is thousands of years old. ', u'Trump is an elected president, not a dictator. ', u'But he has single-handedly shrunk the lifespan of facts to zero. ', u'The post-truth world of his followers won t be overturned by the National Endowment for the Arts. ', u'But the long search for truth   elusive, imperfect, debatable   is what artists do best.

[u'Donald Trump is assembling a team of elites in the service of populism. ', u'That could make him the first  populetist  president.T', u'Trump has promised to improve the prospects of the  forgotten men and women  of America. ', u'To do it, he s assembling a team of 1 percenters who have profited handsomely from the very trends that have weakened the middle class. ', u'If Trump s populetism works, it might help shrink the growing chasm between the wealthy and the rest. ', u'But if it doesn t, the populist backlash that flared during the recent presidential campaign could grow even more intense.M', u'Much of Trump s economic team is now in place, assuming a friendly Republican Senate confirms the nominees, which seems likely. ', u'Here s how Trump s choices to lead the following departments compare with those of President Obama during his first term:Trump s choice: Steve Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs (GS) banker, hedge-fund manager and film financier known for earning hundreds of millions of dollars buying and reviving IndyMac, a California bank that failed in 2008.O', u'Obama s choice: Tim Geithner, a career bureaucrat who served at the World Bank and was president of the New York Federal Reserve when Obama tapped him.T', u'Trump s choice: Wilbur Ross, a private-equity billionaire who has profited from investments in distressed industries such as steel, coal and textiles.O', u'Obama s choice: Gary Locke, a lawyer and politician from Washington state, who became the nation s first Chinese-American governor when elected to his state s highest office in 1996.T', u'Trump s choice: Andy Puzder, a lawyer who s CEO of the CKE Restaurant Holdings, which operates Hardee s, Carl s Jr. and other chains.O', u'Obama s choice: Hilda Solis, a California politician and four-term member of the House of Representatives who became the first Hispanic appointed to a Cabinet position.T', u'Trump s choice: Rick Perry, a Texas politician who served as governor for 14 years.O', u'Obama s choice: Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist who taught at the University of California and worked as a researcher at AT  s (T) Bell Labs.N', u'NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCILTrump s choice: Gary Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, who has worked at the investment bank since 1990.O', u'Obama s choice: Larry Summers, who served as chief economist at the World Bank, Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton and president of Harvard University.S', u'SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATIONTrump s choice: Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).O', u'Obama s choice: Karen Mills, a venture capitalist, private-equity investor and heir to the Tootsie Roll fortune.T', u'Trump obviously prefers business executives and wealthy bankers, while Obama leaned toward academics and policy wonks. ', u'There s no rule dictating which type of Cabinet official is more effective, and some critics complained that Obama s economic team relied too heavily on government maneuvering to stimulate the economy, instead of letting the free market do its thing one reason, perhaps, the economy has been stuck at a subpar 2% growth rate under Obama. ', u'While Trump s team of business All-Stars excels at enriching themselves, however, it s far from obvious how those skills will help improve the lot of ordinary workers. ', u'Trump s economic plan, so far, amounts to standard supply-side theory: slash taxes, prune regulation and watch the economy miraculously surge. ', u'In reality, supply-side stimulus has never worked as planned, and with the national debt bigger than ever, it could backfire if Washington s finances become more strained than they already are. ', u'George W. Bush attempted supply-side reforms when he slashed taxes during his first term but the desired effect never materialized. ', u'Instead of sustained strong growth and shared prosperity, income inequality worsened, with Bush s presidency ending in a grueling recession and an epic housing bust. ', u'Cutting taxes does put more spending money in people s pockets, which in theory ought to boost growth, create jobs and raise pay. ', u'But a lot depends on who gets the extra money and what else is going on in the economy. ', u'And when paychecks get bigger, some people who can suddenly pay their bills more easily decide to work less. ', u'On the whole, economists have generally found that major tax cuts on their own don t correspond with stronger economic growth. ', u'What tax cuts usually do accomplish right away is making the wealthy better off. ', u'That has already happened since Trump got elected on Nov. 8, with stock markets surging on the expectation that lower taxes and less regulation will boost corporate profits during the next few years. ', u'An investor who owns shares in an S  500 index fund has earned a sparkling return of about 6% since Election Day, which is $600 for every $10,000 worth of shares. ', u'Many of the people Trump aims to help don t own stocks, however, which means they ll end up waiting for newfound wealth higher on the income chain to benefit them, somehow. ', u'If Trump and his team are right, empowering the wealthy (even more) will lead to more spending on business investment, more production and more jobs. ', u'But that money could also get spent on equipment, imports or digital services that don t create many jobs. ', u'Trump s wealthy advisers are undoubtedly smart. ', u'But many other smart people have tackled the same problem, with little to show for their efforts.

[u'President Obama on Friday tied election-year hacks of Democrats to Russia s Vladimir Putin, and warned Republicans that  Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave  if he saw so many in the GOP expressing fondness for leaders in Moscow. ', u'Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin,  Obama told reporters at his final press conference of 2016. ', u'I will let you make that determination as to whether there are high-level Russian officials who go off rogue and decide to tamper with the U.S. election process without Vladimir Putin knowing about it. ', u'The president promised unspecific and potentially secret retaliation against Russia, telling Putin,  We can do stuff to you,  and took pains to belittle Moscow s influence over world affairs. ', u'The Russians can t change us or significantly weaken us,  he said. ', u'They are a smaller country, they are a weaker country, their economy doesn t produce anything that anyone wants to buy except oil and gas and arms. ', u'They don t innovate. ', u'But they can impact us if we lose track of who we are. ', u'They can impact us if we abandon our values. ', u'Obama pointed to a public opinion poll that, he said, showed 37 percent of Republicans have a favorable view of Putin, blaming the  fierceness of partisan battle  in the United States for driving Americans into the arms of a historic foe. ', u'During the campaign, Donald Trump often heaped praise on Putin, whom he labeled a stronger leader than the U.S. president. ', u'Over a third of Republican voters approve of Vladimir Putin, the former head of the KGB,  Obama said. ', u'Ronald Reagan would roll over in his grave. ', u'Asked whether his administration will provide evidence to back up charges of Russian meddling, Obama gave a guarded response. ', u'We will provide evidence that we can safely provide, that does not compromise sources and methods. ', u'But I ll be honest with you, when you are talking about cybersecurity, a lot of it is classified and we re not going to provide it, because the way we catch folks is by knowing certain things about them that they may not want us to know, and if we re going to monitor this stuff effectively going forward, we don t want them to know that we know. ', u'But he expressed disbelief that Americans would trust Putin s word over statements from the U.S. spy community. ', u'His comments came shortly after it was disclosed that the FBI agrees with the CIA s conclusions that Russia targeted Democrats with the aim of helping Trump win on Nov. 8. ', u'This is one of those situations where, unless the American people genuinely think that the professionals in the CIA, the FBI, our entire intelligence infrastructure   many of whom, by the way, served in previous administrations, and who are Republicans   are less trustworthy than the Russians, then people should pay attention to what our intelligence agencies say,  Obama said.O', u'Obama said he had confronted Putin during a September meeting about the cyberintrusions, telling the Russian leader to  cut it out. ', u'He said he had delivered a similar warning to President Xi Jinping of China, which U.S. officials have blamed for major cyberattacks against the U.S. government and American firms.A', u'And he promised that Moscow would pay a price for its alleged interference. ', u'Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you, but it is also important for us to do that in a thoughtful, methodical way,  Obama said. ', u'Some of it we do publicly. ', u'Some of it we will do in a way that they know but not everybody will. ', u'Trump and some of his top aides have played down the potential impact of Russia s alleged actions and cast doubt on the CIA s findings. ', u'Last Friday, Trump s transition team dismissed those findings, saying in a statement,  These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. ', u'At his press conference, Obama said the back-and-forth between the White House and the incoming administration would not hamper cooperation on the transfer of power. ', u'I think they would be the first to acknowledge that we have done everything we can to make sure that they are successful, as I promised, and that will continue,  he said.O', u'Obama repeatedly emphasized the importance of a free and independent news media, but also took aim at the press over its widespread coverage of leaked emails linked to Hillary Clinton s campaign. ', u'You guys wrote about it every day, every single leak about every little juicy tidbit of political gossip, including John Podesta s risotto recipe,  the president said. ', u'This was an obsession that dominated the news coverage. ', u'As a result, he said,  I don t think she was treated fairly during the election.

[u'By Joseph Menn(Reuters) - The U.S. agency charged with ensuring that voting machines meet security standards was itself penetrated by a hacker after the November elections, according to a security firm working with law enforcement on the matter.T', u'The security firm, Recorded Future, was monitoring underground electronic markets where hackers buy and sell wares and discovered someone offering log-on credentials for access to computers at the U.S. ', u'Election Assistance Commission, company executives said.P', u'Posing as a potential buyer, the researchers engaged in a conversation with the hacker, said Levi Gundert, vice president of intelligence at the company, and Andrei Barysevich, director of advanced collection.E', u'Eventually they discovered that the Russian-speaking hacker had obtained the credentials of more than 100 people at the election commission after exploiting a common database vulnerability, the researchers said.T', u'The hacker was trying to sell information about the vulnerability to a Middle Eastern government for several thousand dollars, but the researchers alerted law enforcement and said Thursday that the hole had been patched.T', u'The Election Assistance Commission said in a statement late Thursday that it had become aware of a "potential intrusion" and was "working with federal law enforcement agencies to investigate the potential breach and its effects.""The FBI is currently conducting an ongoing criminal investigation," the statement added.F', u'For more news videos visit Yahoo View, available now on iOS and Android.T', u'The election commission certifies voting systems and develops standards for technical guidelines and best practices for election officials across the country.T', u'The researchers said the hacker had an unusual business model, scanning for ways to break into all manner of businesses and other entities and then moving rapidly to sell that access, rather than stealing the data himself.

[u'When the United Nations Security Council on Wednesday proposed a resolution praising outgoing Secretary General Ban Ki-moon for supporting the world s lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community, Russia stood up to its Western colleagues and said no.T', u'The wording about sexual minorities, whom Russian President Vladmir Putin disdains, was replaced with a benign reference to the  most vulnerable  and  marginalized. ', u"The Security Council's split on Mr. Ban s promotion of LGBT rights may be a small thing at the UN. ", u'But it offers a partial clue as to why Mr. Putin, once roundly condemned in Western circles as a dangerous authoritarian, is increasingly viewed in a positive light by conservatives across the West   by the Trump wing of the Republican Party, but also by right-wing leaders in France and other European countries.N', u'Now instead of facing near universal rejection in the West over his oppressive governance at home, his seizure of Crimea, and his intervention in Syria on behalf of a despot, Putin is for some a hero. ', u'Nationalist conservatives see Putin as defending sovereign nationhood in the face of globalization, and traditional values against an onslaught of threatening forces: from multiculturalism and cosmopolitanism to nontraditional sexual identity and radical Islam.A', u'A new poll released this week by YouGov shows that in the US, self-identified Republicans viewing Putin as very or somewhat favorably rose from 10 percent in July 2014 to 37 percent today.T', u'The turnaround in the Russian leader s image in the US can be ascribed almost completely to Trump s repeated contrasting of Putin s strong leadership and President Obama s  weakness,  says Keith Darden, an expert on Russian politics at American University s School of International Service in Washington.T', u'That sunk in with voters drawn to Trump s rhetoric and style, and the result is that  a surprising number of people now see Putin in a positive light as a man of action,  Dr. Darden adds. ', u'They see Putin as a leader who was dealt a weaker hand than the president of the United States, but who has somehow been able to play it better. ', u'Even the uproar this week over Russia s hacking of the presidential campaign and reports Putin signed off on the operation do not seem to be spawning universal condemnation of the Russian leader and his tactics.C', u'CONSERVATIVES SPLIT OVER PUTINIn the US, a conservative split over Putin is emerging as the old guard clashes with rising hard-right nationalists over the direction of foreign policy under a president Trump.T', u'Traditional Republican hawks like Sens. ', u'Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona continue to view Putin as a danger to the West. ', u'Based on standard conservative objections to Putin s disregard for personal freedoms, human rights, and his challenge to the West in Europe, Senator McCain says the Russian leader is a  thug and a murderer and a killer. ', u'He cites shadowy killings of Russian dissidents, Russian undermining of Estonia,  dismembering  of Ukraine, and precision Russian airstrikes on civilian hospitals in Aleppo, Syria.S', u'Some close observers of the Trump transition speculate that Mitt Romney was ultimately passed over in the search for a secretary of State in part because of his perspective from the 2012 presidential campaign that Russia is America s chief geopolitical foe   a view in line with a traditional Republican national-security outlook but at odds with the Trump camp s perspective on Putin.B', u'But others have a different view altogether of Putin. ', u'Pat Buchanan wrote in 2013 that instead of seeing Putin through an old  Cold War paradigm,  conservatives should see Putin as a defender  against the militant secularism of a multicultural and transnational elite. ', u'More recently, some of Trump s closest aides   including Steven Bannon, named Trump s chief White House strategist, and Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, who will be national security adviser   extol the Russian leader for his strong defense of national sovereignty, his promotion of traditional values, and his war against radical Islam.M', u'Bannon told a gathering of European conservatives that the  Judeo-Christian West  should focus more on Putin s promotion of  traditionalism  and values that support  the underpinnings of nationalism. ', u'In August, General Flynn, still just a campaign adviser to then-candidate Trump, said Putin should be considered a partner in the global war on  radical Islamism. ', u'NOT A CRUSADER FOR WHITE SUPREMACYThere s no doubting Putin s opposition to sexual minorities and his deep disdain for what he sees as a decadent West. ', u'In his often-cited 2013 state-of-the-nation speech, the Russian leader defended Russia s  traditional  values against the West s  so-called tolerance,  which he condemned as  genderless and infertile  and for promoting  the equality of good and evil. ', u'But American University s Darden says anyone seeing Putin as some kind of crusader for white, Christian, European culture is misreading the Russian leader. ', u'Putin holds very strongly that anything blurring the line between men and women is something to be fought,  he says. ', u'But he s not a racist, he leads a vast country of diverse cultures, he s proudly built mosques in Moscow. ', u'Some of these other crusades being assigned to the Russian leader are part of   a white-supremacist narrative that has little to do Putin,  he adds. ', u'The revalorization of Putin may be most visible in the Trump camp of Putin admirers, but there are signs the more positive image of the Russian leader is trickling down to Republican voters. ', u'The YouGov poll released this week not only shows an uptick in support over the past two years, but also a decline in antipathy. ', u'Nearly half of Republicans   47 percent   still view Putin somewhat or very unfavorably   but those seeing him  very unfavorably collapsed from 51 percent in 2014 to 10 percent now. ', u'If you look at public opinion in the United States, there were pretty universal negative views of Putin up to this summer,  Darden says. ', u'Then we had the Republican nominee sounding very pro-Putin, and the public shifted shockingly quickly. ', u'Actually, that shift came only among Republican voters   surveys like YouGov s show that Democrats have as negative an opinion of Putin as ever. ', u'That backs up Darden s hunch that Putin s rising favorability in the US has more to do with politics than with the Russian leader s  values  now touted by some Trump nationalists. ', u'It s really the people who are opposed to Obama who are revising their view of Putin,  Darden says. ', u'It s pure partisanship that says,  Putin was the enemy of Obama, therefore he must be a pretty decent guy. ', u'Related stories B', u'Become a part of the Monitor community']

', u'In the overall popular vote, which is not a factor in the Electoral College, Clinton led Trump by about 2.8 million votes.O', u'On December 13, 2016, the states and the District of Columbia filed certificates of ascertainment with a federal government agency. ', u'The Office of the Federal Register coordinates the Electoral College process, and on rare occasions, it also handles the administration of the constitutional amendment process.I', u'In May 1950, President Harry Truman signed Reorganization Plan No. 20, which transferred the administration of the Electoral College from the Secretary of State to the Office of the Federal Register. ', u'Since then, the office has overseen the Electoral College process.T', u'The Office and its Archivist receives two documents from each state.

', u'Federal law does not allow the states to choose an alternate date for the meeting of electors it must be held on the first Monday after the second Wednesday in December.T', u'The state legislature designates where the meeting will take place; it is usually at the state capital. ', u'At this meeting, the electors for the candidate with the most certified votes cast their votes for President and Vice President. ', u'If any electors are unable to carry out their duties on the day of the Electoral College meeting, the laws of each state determine the method for filling vacancies.

[u'A far-reaching Indianapolis Star report indicates that at least 368 youth gymnasts have been abused while in gymnastics programs over the last 20 years, with 115 adults accused of abuse in locations all over the country.T', u'The hard numbers are a follow-up to an August IndyStar report entitled  Out of Balance,  which charged that USA Gymnastics protected coaches over potentially abused gymnasts.

[u"BEIRUT (AP) -- Diplomats sought to salvage the evacuation of eastern Aleppo after it stalled Friday amid recriminations by both sides in Syria's civil war, raising fears the cease-fire could collapse with thousands still desperate to escape the rebel enclave.T", u'The Aleppo evacuation was suspended after a report of shooting at a crossing point into the enclave.

', u'Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. ', u'"Aleppo is now a synonym for hell."The halt also appeared to be linked to a separate deal to remove thousands of people from the government-held Shiite villages of Foua and Kfarya that are under siege by the rebels. ', u"The Syrian government says those evacuations and the one in eastern Aleppo must be done simultaneously, but the rebels say there's no connection.T", u'The foreign minister of Turkey, a main backer of the rebels, said he was talking to his counterpart in Iran, a top ally of the Syrian government, to try to resume the evacuation.A', u'A closed emergency meeting of the U.N.

', u'The council meeting ended with diplomats saying they would convene again this weekend.T', u"The cease-fire and evacuation marked the end of the rebels' most important stronghold in the 5-year-old civil war. ", u'The suspension demonstrated the fragility of the cease-fire deal, in which civilians and fighters in the few remaining blocks of the rebel enclave were to be taken to opposition-held territory nearby.I', u'In announcing the suspension, Syrian state TV said rebels were trying to smuggle out captives who had been seized in the enclave after ferocious battles with troops supporting President Bashar Assad.S', u'Several opposition activists said Syrian troops shot and killed four people in one bus, but the incident could not be independently confirmed.T', u'The Lebanon-based pan-Arab Al-Mayadeen TV broadcast images of the government buses apparently returning evacuees to eastern Aleppo after the road was closed.A', u'Al-Manar TV, the media arm of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group that supports Assad, said Syrian government supporters had closed the road used by evacuees from Aleppo, demanding the wounded from Foua and Kfarya be allowed to leave.S', u'Syrian state media said rebels shelled a road that was supposed to be used by people leaving the villages. ', u"But the opposition's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Hezbollah fighters backed by Assad ally Iran had cut the road to protest a lack of progress in the evacuations.B", u'Buses that arrived at a collection point in the Hama countryside to pick up evacuees from the villages waited for hours to no avail.L', u'Later, two rebel spokesmen privy to the talks said the fighters besieging the villages, including the al-Qaida linked Fatah al-Sham Front, had agreed to evacuate several hundred wounded from the villages.T', u"Turkey's state-run Anadolu Agency said Prime Minister Binali Yildirim had called Iranian Presidential Deputy Ishak Cihangiri and told him he was ready to cooperate with Tehran on the evacuation issue.R", u'Reports differed on how many people remain in the Aleppo enclave, ranging from 15,000 to 40,000 civilians, along with an estimated 6,000 fighters.T', u'There also were contradictory reports on the number of evacuees. ', u'Syrian state TV put it at more than 9,000; the Syrian state news agency said 8,079 opposition fighters and their families have left; and Russia, a key Assad ally, said over 9,500 people, including more than 4,500, were taken out.M', u'More than 2,700 children have been evacuated in the past 24 hours, including the sick, wounded and those without their parents, UNICEF said.

If these children are not evacuated urgently, they could die," UNICEF said in a statement. ', u'There are still "high numbers of women and infants, children under 5, that need to get out," added Elizabeth Hoff, Syrian representative for the World Health Organization, speaking by phone from western Aleppo. ', u'During Thursday night\'s evacuation, Pawel Krzysiek of the International Committee of the Red Cross told The Associated Press he could sense "fear, desperation (and) anxiety" among those waiting to escape. ', u'The civilians   including children and the elderly, the wounded and the sick   were out in the cold, "burning the plastic, trying to get some sort of heat to warm themselves," said Krzysiek, who is still in Aleppo. ', u'"It\'s the people leaving their house behind, their lives behind. It is very often they are facing impossible choices and this all occurs at the very individual level and it is difficult to compare with anything else," he said. ', u'"This is what the people are going through with their families, their relatives. This is really something very personal for them. I have seen sadness. I have seen really sadness in the people eyes. Heartbreaking sadness, broken lives, heartbreaking stories," Krzysiek added. ', u'Before the operation was suspended Friday, four convoys of ambulances and buses left Aleppo, Syrian state TV said, noting that some evacuees used their own vehicles. ', u'At the United Nations, U.S. ', u'Ambassador Samantha Power said she favors a French-drafted resolution calling for independent international monitors to oversee the evacuation. ', u'But Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin said "it takes weeks to deploy observers." P', u'Power said the Security Council could possibly vote this weekend on the resolution, but if there was a stalemate, an emergency special session of the General Assembly was possible. ', u'Churkin said Russia opposed that idea. ', u'In a year-end news conference, U.S. ', u'President Barack Obama said he feels "responsible" for some of the suffering in Syria, but he defended his decision to avoid significant military action there.

[u'On Tuesday The New York Times  on this year s cyberattacks on the Democratic National Committee s computer systems by hackers working with the Russian government. ', u'The piece is well researched and worth the read. ', u'But the most jarring tidbit from the report is how the hackers gained access to the DNC: a common email spear-phishing scam.A', u'According to The Times, emails were sent to members of the DNC disguised as notifications from Google s (, ) Gmail telling them someone had attempted to sign into their account from Ukraine. ', u'The phony messages included instructions for recipients to click an embedded link in order to change their passwords.A', u'And, it worked.E', u'Employees clicked the links and essentially handed over the keys to their email accounts and the DNC s network. ', u'The saddest thing is that by following a few basic steps, employees might have realized the phishing email was fake and saved a lot of headaches.B', u'But phishing attempts are so scary because of how simple they are to pull off. ', u'Just a quick message, a dash of social engineering and you ve got an international news story. ', u'It s pretty amazing,  Kevin Haley, director of product management for Symantec Security Response, told Yahoo Finance. ', u'When you look at those attacks, those are basically the standard bread and butter phishing attack. ', u'Although all of the things around it are extremely well done. ', u'Criminals are a bigger threat than foreign governmentsNow before you work yourself into a frenzied panic for fear that a foreign government is lurking online hoping to crack into your email and steal your backlog of chain letters from your uncle Ted, it s important to note that Google says fewer than 0.1% of users receive phishing emails from state actors. ', u'What s more, the company says targeted individuals generally include  activists, journalists and policy-makers. ', u'If, however, you receive a phishing email from a foreign government, Google will provide you with a special warning alerting you to the fact.U', u'Unfortunately, the sad truth about the internet is that there are still plenty of other criminals and malicious actors who would be more than happy to set up shop in your email account or break into your computer and hold it for ransom. ', u'Even more likely are attacks aimed at your work email to attack your company s systems.C', u'Computer security company  that its anti-phishing system was triggered more than 30 million times in Q2 2015.

', u'With a little knowledge and some patience.S', u'Staying safeAccording to Haley, the biggest giveaway that the email you re reading is a phishing attempt is if it has typos or poor grammar.M', u'More sophisticated attackers, though, will ensure their emails are crisp and typo-free, so you ll have to do a bit more investigating. ', u'Kaspersky recommends hovering your pointer over any links in emails to preview them for typos or inconsistencies. ', u'If it s a phishing scheme, the link preview will point to the wrong site. ', u'So if you get an email from Amazon and the link points you to stealyourstuff.com, you know it s a fraud.B', u'Better yet, don t even bother with the link in your email and go to the official website named in the message instead. ', u'In other words, if you get a email from FedEx or Google asking you to click the link in the message to check your account, just go to FedEx or Google s website instead.A', u'And don t fall for messages urging you to click on any links in your email immediately. ', u'When you see that kind of urgency of getting you to try to click on something that s a big warning sign,  Haley said.O', u'Outside of links, you ll also want to avoid downloading any files you re not expecting to receive, even if they come from family or friends. ', u'There s no reason for major companies to ask you to download invoices or order forms via your email unless they ve already told you to look out for them. ', u'And while you might think you can trust your friend s email, there s always the chance that it too has been hacked and is being used to attack others.N', u'Naturally, one of the best ways to prevent a phishing attack is to install a solid anti-virus security program on your computer. ', u'Many modern AV solutions offer protection against spam and phishing attempts.I', u'If, however, you think you ve already been the victim of a phishing scam, the best thing to do is disconnect your computer from the internet. ', u'Haley says this can prevent any malicious software on your system from sending your data back to the criminals. ', u'Next, you ll want to run your AV program to try to remove any malware that you may have.

[u"WASHINGTON (AP)   Taxpayers will fork over nearly $10 billion more next year to cover double-digit premium hikes for subsidized health insurance under President Barack Obama's law, according to a study being released Thursday.T", u'The analysis from the Center for Health and Economy comes as the Republican-led Congress is preparing to repeal "Obamacare" and replace it with a GOP alternative whose details have yet to be worked out. ', u'With incoming President Donald Trump likely to sign such legislation, historic coverage gains under the 2010 health law are at stake.T', u'The study estimates that the cost of premium subsidies under the Affordable Care Act will increase by $9.8 billion next year, rising from $32.8 billion currently to $42.6 billion.T', u'The average monthly subsidy will increase by $76, or 26 percent, from $291 currently to $367 in 2017.C', u'Currently more than 8 in 10 consumers buying private health insurance through HealthCare.gov and state markets receive tax credits from the government to help pay their premiums. ', u'Those subsidies are designed to rise along with premiums, shielding consumers from sudden increases. ', u'But the bill ultimately gets passed on to taxpayers.S', u'Shortly before Election Day, the administration revealed that premiums for a midlevel benchmark plan on HealthCare.gov would jump by an average of 25 percent next year.A', u'Administration officials are touting the premium subsidies as they race to sign up as many people as possible before open enrollment ends Jan. 31, about a week after Obama leaves the White House. ', u'Upbeat, carefree ads for HealthCare.gov say most consumers can find subsidized coverage for as little as $50 to $100 a month.R', u'Republicans are planning a multistep process to first repeal the health law and replace it later. ', u'The new study is unlikely to affect the "repeal" part of the debate.H', u'However, the findings could affect how Republicans design future subsidies that would be part of their replacement legislation. ', u'Some kind of limit on assistance is more likely to appeal to them.U', u'Under current law, "you get a premium increase, you pour more money in," said economist Douglas Holtz-Eakin, founder of the Center for Health and Economy. ', u'"The concern is that will feed more premium increases." He predicted that Republicans would take a different approach.H', u'Holtz-Eakin, a former Congressional Budget Office director, is also a longtime GOP adviser. ', u'However, the center functions as a nonpartisan research organization, and its work is overseen by a board of experts that spans the political spectrum. ', u"The Associated Press requested the center's new estimate.A", u'After reviewing the study, the Obama administration said that despite the increase in premiums, the health care law is still helping to reduce federal deficits, keeping the program affordable for taxpayers. ', u'The law also raised taxes and cut Medicare spending."', u'"The Affordable Care Act is covering 20 million Americans, and 2017 marketplace premiums remain on par with the Congressional Budget Office\'s November 2009 projections," spokesman Aaron Albright said.A', u'A health economist who also reviewed the study said it shows that the law is working as designed."', u'"Since the premiums for 2017 are a lot higher than for 2016, it\'s no surprise that premium tax credits would go up as well," said Paul Ginsburg, who directs the Brookings Institution health policy center. ', u'"The premiums in 2015 and 2016 appear to have been unduly low."Obama\'s law has helped drive the nation\'s uninsured rate to a historic low of about 9 percent. ', u"It offers subsidized private health insurance to people don't have access to job-based coverage, along with a state option to expand Medicaid for low-income people.I", u'Insurers say the spike in premiums is due to lower-than-projected enrollment, patients who turned out to be sicker than expected, people gaming the system to get coverage only when they need medical care, and a premium stabilization system that has not worked as intended.T', u'The administration says the higher premiums are a one-time market correction, and not a sign that the law\'s insurance markets are slipping into a "death spiral" of rising premiums and declining enrollment.A', u'Although Congress will begin the repeal debate soon after it convenes in January, immediate changes that would affect coverage for 2017 appear to be highly unlikely. ', u'Republican leaders have said they want a smooth transition to the new system. ', u'Thursday is expected to be a big day for HealthCare.gov because Dec. 15 is the last day that consumers can sign up or make changes to existing coverage and have them take effect Jan. 1.']

[u'Paris (AFP) - The Moroccan jihadist accused of attacking a high-speed train in France before he was overpowered by US servicemen has said he was targeting Americans, a source close to the investigation has told AFP.A', u'Ayoub El Khazzani\'s lawyer said he had a "precise, well-defined target", the source said.T', u'The lawyer, Sarah Mauger-Poliak, is said to have told investigators: "It was no accident that he boarded the first-class part of the train."However, the lawyer said her client had told investigators he had not intended to "carry out a massacre and kill just anyone" on the Amsterdam to Paris train in August 2015.T', u'The account differs from earlier versions of the story that the gunman has told investigators.

[u'A month before the 2016 presidential election, Monica Crowley, Fox News analyst and conservative columnist for the Washington Times, tweeted a photo of herself standing in front of the Berlin Wall with a caption that read,  Walls work.

', u'Several weeks ago, I traveled through Central Europe and witnessed firsthand this Islamic tsunami. ', u'Across Austria and Germany, I saw tens of thousands of people pouring in, with few constraints on their whereabouts and behavior. ', u'It was clear that it was only a matter of time before the chaos turned far more convulsive and violent. ', u'Let s be clear: Some of them may be fleeing war and persecution, but most are not. ', u'In fact, only about 10 percent of the new arrivals are from Syria; the other 90 percent are from elsewhere in the Middle East, North Africa and countries like Pakistan and Indonesia who are using the European Union s open doors-open borders policy to reach the West for social welfare and the longer-term goal of spreading Islam. ', u'Crowley also relayed secondhand anecdotal evidence:  We were told that many Muslims turned away food provided by the International Red Cross because it was stamped with a Christian cross. ', u'We were also told that many of the men carry weapons, knives specifically, which they often use to threaten those trying to help them. ', u'Europe is quickly reaching the point of no return,  she added. ', u'We have more time to prevent such a transformation here, but that time may be shorter than we think. ', u'The Islamic Trojan Horse looks next to America. ', u'Will we let it in? ', u'In March following the terrorist attacks in Brussels, Crowley ratcheted up the rhetoric:  Islam is no mere religion. ', u'It is an all-encompassing ideological system that dictates everything from law (Shariah) to personal relationships which also have religious elements. ', u'Conquest and subjugation of the infidel lands are integral to this totalitarian ideology, by the sword, if necessary. ', u'It therefore requires that we fight this war the way we fought the Nazis in World War II and Soviet communists during the Cold War: comprehensively and strategically, with every available military, economic, ideological, diplomatic, cyber- and religious lever. ', u'We must stop this threat before it metastasizes further and fully consumes Western Civilization. ', u'In June, following the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Crowley accused President Obama of trying  to change the narrative from the truth  by refusing to label the gunman a radical Islamic terrorist and the shooting  an act of war against the United States. ', u'Islamic supremacism they cannot and will not fight,  she wrote of the administration. ', u'The global jihad is an endless, relentless religiously driven violent movement of conquest. ', u'In August, Crowley told Fox News  Sean Hannity that the parents of Hillary Clinton s top aide, Huma Abedin, are  essentially tools of the Saudi regime  bent on spreading Islam  and Sharia across the West, including in the United States. ', u'This is Huma Abedin s life s work,  Crowley said. ', u'And like Trump, Crowley encouraged Russia to release Clinton s emails during the campaign. ', u'I guess Putin is going to have to do it. ']

', u"Yahoo is requiring users to change their passwords and invalidating security questions so they can't be used to hack into accounts.

[u"Washington (AFP) - Russia's alleged cyber-meddling in the US presidential election demands immediate retaliation if the country is to deter future attacks of the kind, national security experts said Friday.D", u"Delivering a response could provide an important test of America's still-developing offensive cyber warfare capabilities, but any retaliation must be calibrated and proportional to keep from escalating the conflict, they said.P", u'President Barack Obama set the stage Friday for the riposte, pointing a finger directly at his Russian counterpart for a hacking and leaking operation the CIA believes aimed to damage Hillary Clinton\'s campaign."', u'"Not much happens in Russia without Vladimir Putin," Obama said.W', u'While Moscow has denied the allegations as "ridiculous" -- as has President-elect Donald Trump -- the US leader said Russia needs to know there will be consequences to hacking."', u'"Our goal continues to be to send a clear message to Russia or others not to do this to us because we can do stuff to you," Obama told a news conference."', u'"Some of it we do publicly. Some of it we will do in a way that they know, but not everybody will."Retired Admiral James Stavridis, the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander and now Dean of The Fletcher School at Tufts University, said the need to retaliate was urgent."', u'"We need to respond proportionally and immediately," he told AFP."', u'"This should include presentation of evidence publicly followed by a similar intrusion into Russian cyber systems."- \'No choice but to respond\' -Pressure on the White House to act has mounted since early October, when top US intelligence officials announced that "senior-most officials" in Russia were behind the break-ins to Democratic Party computers and email accounts that led to the publication of embarrassing documents by WikiLeaks.V', u'Vice President Joe Biden said at the time that the United States would retaliate to send a message to Putin.

', u'But "you never want to limit your responses to one domain."One model is the tightening of US sanctions against North Korea after it leaked embarrassing communications from Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 2014.

', u'"My own view is that our response shouldn\'t be covert -- it should be overt, for everybody to see." - No cyber-warfare playbook - C', u'Cilluffo says the US government has been slow to develop a "playbook" of a range of measured responses to cyber-attacks, as it has for the traditional battlefield. ', u'Doing so is crucial for managing any conflict, he adds. ', u'"We have some of the most advanced capabilities" in cyber warfare. ', u'"But we also have to realize that we are the most connected and have the most to lose," given that many smaller adversaries are still capable of what amounts to "cyber drive-by shootings." "', u'"Companies, the private sector are on the front line," he noted. ', u'Obama is also under the pressure of time. ', u'President-elect Trump takes office on January 20. ', u'His promise of a reset of relations with Russia, including possibly lifting sanctions, and his repeated dismissals of the Russian election hacking allegations, suggest he may not be willing to retaliate.

', u'We already covered the best new additions in iOS 10.2 earlier this week following the new software s public release, and the star of the show has to be the 100+ new emoji. ', u'Apple packed in a number of emoji that have been high on people s lists for years, such as a facepalm emoji, a shrug emoji, a clown face emoji, a lying face emoji, a man dancing emoji and plenty more.

', u'Thankfully, those issues seem to be rare cases and are not widespread.T', u'There are other issues that aren t isolated cases, however.T', u'The biggest complaint following Apple s iOS 10.2 update is that users who were experiencing problems with battery life on their iPhones have not seen those issues resolved in iOS 10.2. ', u'In fact, many users are reporting that these problems have only gotten worse with the update.T', u'This battery issue in iOS 10.2 most often manifests itself in one of two ways: some users report that their phones completely shut down when the remaining charge drops to around 30%, while others say that they see huge drop-offs in battery life when the remaining charge reaches around 50%. ', u'So, for example, the phone s remaining charge might jump from 50% to 25% in the blink of an eye.A', u'Another aggravating bug that hasn t yet been fixed in iOS 10.2 is the EarPods issue that people have been complaining about since September.

[u'Charleston (United States) (AFP) - Dylann Roof, the self-described white supremacist who gunned down nine African American parishioners at a historic church in Charleston last year, was found guilty of all charges Thursday and could now face the death penalty.A', u'A federal jury in the southern US port city needed only two hours to find Roof, 22, guilty on 33 counts, including hate crimes resulting in death.T', u'The attack on a Bible study group at the historic church known to most as "Mother Emanuel" shocked the nation, and exposed the deep divides in America over race and access to guns."', u'"He executed them because he believed they were nothing more than animals," federal prosecutor Nathan Williams said during his closing argument."', u'"His actions in the church are the best reflections of the vastness of his hatred."The guilty verdict sends the trial into the penalty phase, which begins January 3. ', u"Roof, who did not testify during the trial, has elected to represent himself despite the prosecutors' vow to seek a death sentence.T", u'The defendant showed no emotion and traced his fingers on the table in front of him as the 33 guilty verdicts were read out.I', u'In a videotaped confession shown in court last week, Roof calmly told FBI agents that he carried out the June 17, 2015 attack at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal church in retaliation for what he said were crimes committed by blacks against whites.T', u'Three people survived the shooting spree. ', u'None of the survivors or family members of victims spoke to reporters after the trial concluded.D', u"Defense attorney David Bruck hinted at mental illness in his closing argument, saying Roof had not grown up in a family with racist beliefs, had no escape plan or money, and hadn't communicated with white supremacists.T", u'The racist beliefs were "downloaded directly from the internet into his brain... Everything he\'s doing is just an imitation," Bruck said.H', u'He called on jurors to "look past the surface" and consider that Roof didn\'t realize he had shot nine people, thinking he had killed four or five.T', u'The gunman, wearing heavy clothing on a hot summer evening, was a loner without a best friend, he added.- Multiple visits -FBI agent Joseph Hamski testified on Tuesday that Roof had traveled a half-dozen times to the church in the months before the shooting.R', u'Roof documented the trips with photographs in which he posed in front of historic sites linked to the US South during times of slavery, sometimes wearing a jacket with the flags of apartheid-era South Africa and Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe.M', u'Many of the images were posted in a hate-filled online manifesto that included racist language directed at African Americans and other minorities.R', u'Roof chuckled during his confession, saying he hadn\'t gone to another church "because there could be white people there."The gunman said he became inspired after reading about a Florida neighborhood watchman\'s 2012 killing of unarmed black teenager Trayvon Martin, a case that sparked widespread protests. ', u'"After I read that, I typed in -- for some reason I typed in black on white crime," Roof said. ', u'"I had to do it, because somebody had to do something because black people are killing white people every day." - Emotional testimony - T', u'The trial featured gripping, heartrending testimony from survivors of the shooting at the church -- the oldest African Methodist Episcopal church in the southern US, dating back to the late 1700s when a handful of slaves gathered to worship with free African Americans. ', u"One survivor had lain in a pool of her son and her aunt's blood, cradling her granddaughter as the massacre unfolded. ", u'The young girl also lived.

R', u"Roof's mother had a heart attack during the emotional testimony and had to be hospitalized. ", u"Roof's lawyers called no witnesses, resting their case after failing to persuade the judge to allow two mental health experts to testify on behalf of the defendant. ", u'After the jury was dismissed, Roof calmly told Judge Richard Gergel that he still wishes to represent himself during the sentencing phase. ', u'Gergel cautioned against that, telling the young man that his lawyers "zealously defended you." "', u'"It\'s important to appreciate the gravity of the situation," he said. ', u'Other charges against Roof included hate crimes resulting in an attempt to kill; obstruction of exercise of religion resulting in death or an attempt to kill; and assorted firearms charges with the intent to commit murder or a violent crime. ', u'Roof is also facing state murder charges in South Carolina, though that trial is not due to begin until January 17. ', u'State prosecutors also are seeking the death penalty.']

[u'Britain is set to become the first country in the world to legally offer "three-parent baby" fertility treatments after regulators gave the green light.T', u'The technique, which uses DNA from two women and a man, would allow mothers who carry disease-causing mutations in their mitochondrial genes to give birth to children free of the illness.B', u'British lawmakers had voted in February to allow the treatment, which uses in-vitro fertilisation (IVF), but clinics needed to obtain licences from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).H', u'HFEA chair Sally Cheshire hailed the "historic and important" decision to license the treatment, calling it "a world first"."', u'"I\'m sure patients who might be in line for this treatment will be really pleased by what we\'ve decided today," she said, but added: "We will proceed with caution."HFEA member Andrew Greenfield said the board took the decision because the "evidence suggests we should move forward".A', u'An independent panel of experts last month said the practice should be "cautiously adopted" to prevent certain genetic diseases from being passed on to future generations.M', u'Mitochondria are structures in cells which generate vital energy and contain their own set of genes called mDNA which is passed through the mother.M', u"Mitochondrial diseases cause symptoms ranging from poor vision to diabetes and muscle wasting, and health officials estimate around 125 babies are born with the mutations in Britain every year.- 'New hope' -The first baby conceived using mitochondrial donation was born earlier this year in Mexico, where there are no rules on its use, but Britain is the first to officially authorise it.G", u'Greenfield said the Mexico birth was "encouraging but only a single case, so let\'s not get carried away".O', u'Opponents have warned that the move paves the way for "designer babies".C', u'Cheshire told AFP that the ruling did not put the ethics of genetics on a "slippery slope".

', u'"This is five years...with an extensive pubic dialogue, and a very heavy debate in parliament."The treatment involves the embryo receiving the usual "nuclear" DNA from the mother and father, as well as a small amount of healthy mitochondrial DNA (mDNA) from a female donor.T', u'The British review panel recommended its clinical use "in specific circumstances... where inheritance of the disease is likely to cause death or serious disease and where there are no acceptable alternatives."The first women could receive the treatment as early as March or April, with a pioneering research centre in Newcastle, northeast England, expected to kickstart the programme."', u'"We are delighted by today\'s decision," said Doug Turnbull, director of the Wellcome Centre for Mitochondrial Research at Newcastle University. ', u'"In Newcastle, we will be aiming to treat up to 25 carefully selected patients a year with the mitochondrial donation technique." R', u'Robert Meadowcroft, CEO of charity Muscular Dystrophy, said the decision gave affected parents "new hope and choice for the first time", but urged caution. ', u'"We recognise this approach is not without some uncertainty, and, in any trial, success cannot be guaranteed," he said.

[u' Officials had said euthanizing the deer, which was being held at an East Harlem animal shelter, was  the only humane and safe recourse.  (WABC)The one-antlered male deer at the center of a dramatic dispute between New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew Cuomo died Friday afternoon, marking a tragic end to two days of local political bickering.T', u'The deer reportedly drew crowds after first appearing in Harlem s Jackie Robinson Park earlier this month.

Cuomo stepped in and, according to a statement released by his office,  directed DEC to offer assistance to the city to transport and find a new habitat for it immediately. ', u'That s when things really started to heat up. ', u'According to the Times, state environmental officials claimed they had actually informed city officials that, rather than return the deer to the same densely populated part of East Harlem where it had been captured, they were welcome to release it somewhere within the 200 acres of woods that comprise Manhattan s Inwood Hill Park.N', u'Not so, said de Blasio s office, referring the Times to an email sent earlier that day to a city parks department official by state wildlife biologist Ken Scarlatelli that said,  Bottom line is the options are release back into Harlem or euthanasia. ', u'The Times also noted that, according to state guidelines, not only is a permit is required in order to capture and relocate deer within New York state, but  permits are not issued to relocate deer to the wild, because acceptable release sites are not available and because the poor chances for deer survival do not warrant the risks. ', u'Yet conservation department officials argued that there was technically no ban against relocation and that the city could have moved the deer anywhere it wanted. ', u'On the contrary, de Blasio spokeswoman Grybauskas insisted that the state had specifically instructed the city against transporting the animal across county lines. ', u'Releasing the deer in Manhattan is clearly not safe for New Yorkers or the animal,  Grybauskas said in a statement late Thursday.  and the state s position was that euthanization was the preferred route. ', u'Later, the state reversed years of their own policy and offered to help relocate Lefty. ', u'The state itself has said it is not safe to relocate deer, and so the only humane and safe recourse is to euthanize the deer, and that will happen in the morning. ', u'The state conservation department replied with a statement of its own, reiterating that, while Lefty s future was ultimately in the city s hands,  we stand ready to assist the city with the safe transportation of the deer to an alternative location. ', u'The political tug of war continued well into the next day, with de Blasio defending the city s decision to kill the deer on his radio show Friday morning. ', u'This is a case where it s a really bad situation, unfortunately,  he said. ', u'It s nothing any of us want, but I think it s a question of is it going to be a quick and merciful death versus potentially a very long, painful process. ', u'Relocating the deer, the mayor argued, would be  inhumane in its own right. ', u'The governor disagreed. ', u'We want to do everything we can to save the Harlem deer,  Cuomo tweeted shortly before 11:30 a.m. ', u'We have told the city that the feds or we can transport it upstate today.   .@NYSDEC:We want to do everything we can to save the Harlem deer.

[u'DALLAS (AP)   A chemical leak from an asphalt plant that led Corpus Christi officials to warn residents this week not to drink the water was apparently reported a week earlier, according to an email from a state environmental official that was obtained Friday.T', u'The internal email sent Wednesday by Susan Clewis, a regional director for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, contained an incident report that described the leak as a "backflow incident from a chemical tank impacting the public water system." It was reported Dec. 7 at a plant run by Ergon Asphalt and Emulsions.T', u"The email doesn't say who initially reported the leak on Dec. 7 or to whom. ", u'It says the state environmental agency was notified around 3 p.m. on Wednesday. ', u'City officials notified the public that evening."', u'"Obviously we are concerned about that initial report, that this may have been known for seven days and it may have been going on for that long. And why did it take so long for TCEQ to get notified?" asked Luis Moreno, chief of staff for state Sen. Juan Hinojosa, whose district includes Corpus Christi. ', u'"Those are all things that I think are starting to be figured out right now."Dan McQueen, the mayor of the Gulf Coast city of about 300,000 people, has said local officials also only learned of the leak on Wednesday.N', u'Neither Clewis nor city officials responded to requests for comment on Friday, when many schools remained closed for a second day.T', u'The TCEQ report indicates that a combination of Indulin AA-86 and hydrochloric acid leaked into the water supply.I', u"Indulin is an asphalt emulsifying agent that's corrosive and can burn the eyes, skin and respiratory tract if a person comes into contact with concentrated amounts. ", u'The amber liquid is considered a hazardous material by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and could cause damage to internal organs."', u'"You don\'t expect to see it in water," said Terry Clawson, a spokesman with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.U', u'Up to 24 gallons of it may have seeped into a pipeline carrying water, allowing it to move to other areas of the city, Kim Womack, a spokeswoman for the city, said Thursday.E', u'Ergon has said in a statement that it has been in contact with the TCEQ and was "working cooperatively to provide all information to ensure state officials can remedy the situation as quickly as possible." Bill Miller, a company spokesman, declined to explain Friday how a hazardous chemical may have entered the water supply.S', u'State and city officials have referred to a "backflow problem" at the plant, and Womack said inspectors didn\'t find a device in place that prevents contaminated water from flowing backward into a potable water supply. ', u'Ergon, though, has argued that the plant does have a prevention device, Womack said.M', u'Miller said Ergon Inc. is leasing the property for manufacturing purposes. ', u"The privately held Flowood, Mississippi-based conglomerate's Corpus Christi subsidiary makes paving and pavement preservation products. ", u'The 62-year-old company also has refining, trucking and real estate businesses.S', u'State and federal environmental records list no problems at the plant over the past five years. ', u'Nationwide, the Environmental Protection Agency reports no current "significant violations" at Ergon facilities but shows seven receiving fines since 2010, the highest $17,200 paid by a Vicksburg, Mississippi, refinery.A', u'A Texas Commission on Environmental Quality record lists an emergency response at the site on March 24 as having been closed. ', u'Clawson, the agency spokesman, said he had no details.M', u'Meanwhile, city officials on Friday continued to ease restrictions on the use of tap water while workers flushed water pipes to make sure any remnants of the chemical are removed.L', u'Limited use of water is allowed in some neighborhoods. ', u'Water can be used for showering and washing clothes, but not yet for drinking. ', u'They warn that young children and those with weakened immune systems should avoid bathing so as not to accidentally swallow the water.O', u'Officials said Thursday that residents in some parts of the city can consume water however they wish, but there were still sections Friday where authorities urged no use at all.I', u'In additional to shuttering schools, the leak also continued to disrupt commerce. ', u'Officials said plenty of bottled water has been donated to help residents. ', u'City officials have said that no one has turned up at area hospitals with symptoms that might indicate they were sickened or burned by the chemical. ', u'A city councilman, Michael Hunter, told the Corpus Christi Caller-Times that it was unlikely the leaked chemical was concentrated enough to do harm, but that every precaution must be taken. ', u'The incident is the latest in a string of water scares for Corpus Christi. ', u'In May, the city issued its third boil-water advisory in a year as a precaution after nitrogen-rich runoff from rain flowed into the water system, resulting in low chlorine disinfectant levels in the water supply. ', u'Boil-water notices were issued last year because of elevated levels of E. coli and another for low chlorine levels, the Caller-Times previously reported. ', u'The notices mirrored two others that were issued in 2007. ', u'City crews have worked to reconfigure some water mains to ensure that water keeps circulating and to prevent bacteria growth. ', u'But an overarching concern is an old water system where more than half of 225 miles of cast-iron pipe needs to be upgraded. ___ B', u'Bajak reported from Houston. ', u'Associated Press writer Paul J. Weber in Austin also contributed to this report.']
